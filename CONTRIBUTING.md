## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The project uses Hugo as framework for the website. Therefore, Hugo must first be installed.
You can find the instructions in the official [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

Validate the installation by running `hugo version` in the command line.

In addition, we use some node packages, for example pagefind for the search. To install the packages,
install the node package manager `npm` on your machine. Instructions are available in the [official documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Validate the installation by running `npm --version` in the command line.

### Start the development server

First of all, we have to the install the node packages by running:

```zsh
npm i
```

Then, we can start the integrated hugo server with:

```zsh
hugo server
```

Check the output and follow the link to see a local preview of the changes.

To initialize the search index, run the following command in a separate terminal window:

```zsh
npx -y pagefind --site public
```

### Run pre-commit hooks

We use the [pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/) to run some checks to ensure a consistent code quality.

First of all, install the package manager uv: [Installing uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Then, install the `pre-commit` tool:

```zsh
uv tool install pre-commit --with pre-commit-uv --force-reinstall
```

Now, enable `pre-commit` to run the check every time you want to commit changes:

```zsh
pre-commit install
```

## Content Contributions

### Add new pages

To add a new country:

```zsh
hugo new country/${COUNTRY} # Replace ${COUNTRY} with the English country name in lowercase
```

To add a new operator:

```zsh
hugo new operator/${OPERATOR} # Replace ${OPERATOR} with the English operator name in lowercase
```

To add a new booking platform:

```zsh
hugo new booking/${PLATFORM} # Replace ${PLATFORM} with the name of the booking platform
```

### Use AI for translation and quality checks

We provide commands to automatically translate and check pages. To define the commands, we use the [OpenCode AI framework](https://opencode.ai/). It's open source and can be used with different providers, models (OpenAI, Github Copilot, Anthropic), and [IDEs](https://opencode.ai/docs/ide/#installation).

#### Installation

1. Install OpenCode: https://opencode.ai/docs#install.
2. Run `opencode auth login` in a terminal, select the provider and log in.
3. Open the OpenCode CLI with `opencode` in a terminal.
4. Run `/models` to select the model you want to use.

Inside the OpenCode Terminal, you can ask any question, similarly to Github Copilot or Claude Chat. In addition, we provide helpful commands:

- `/translate {page}`: Update the translations and add missing translations of the page. `{page}` can be the name of an operator, a country, a booking plattform, or a path to a file.
- `/check {page}`: Check the page for common mistakes and report them. `{page}` can be the name of an operator, a country, a booking plattform, or a path to a file.

That's the recommended way. However, you can still use other frontend ends like GitHub Copilot Chat and Claude Code. We provide an [`AGENTS.md`](https://agents.md/) file for these providers in the repository, but the custom commands are not available without OpenCode.
