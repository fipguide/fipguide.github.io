Translate the page $ARGUMENTS into the other languages.
If the page already exists, only translate the added or changed parts. If the page doesn't exist, create it.

Follow these rules:

- Do not modify the meaning of content. Translate as 1:1 where possible.
- Use names of the translation language for cities (e.g., KÃ¶ln in German, "Cologne" in English and "eau de Cologne" in French).
- Enforce the Glossary defined in `AGENTS.md`.
- Do not translate the keys of the front matter section, the keys of shortcodes or partials.
- Use the corresponding archetype (defined in `archetypes`) as base for the translated page.
- Update anchors of internal links to the corresponding section in the target language.
