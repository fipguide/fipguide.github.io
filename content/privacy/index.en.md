### Personal Data, Purpose of Data Processing, and Legal Basis
Personal data are details that can be clearly assigned to a person. These include, among other things, details such as full name, address, email, and telephone number. When you visit our website, additional data are automatically collected for technical reasons (IP address, start and end of the session, date and time of the request, accessed subpage on our website, type and version of the browser, operating system, referrer URL). These technical details can be personal data in individual cases. As a rule, we only use these technical details if this is necessary (for technical reasons) for the operation and protection of our website against attacks and misuse, as well as pseudonymized or anonymized for statistical purposes.

If you contact us via the inquiry form on the website or by email, the data you provide (first name, last name, address, telephone number, email) will be stored by us for six months for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent. Processing of your personal data for specific purposes (e.g., use of your email for newsletters, advertising) can also take place based on your consent. You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future. This also applies to the revocation of consent declarations that were given to us before the GDPR came into effect. You will be informed separately about the purposes and consequences of a revocation or non-granting of consent in the corresponding text of the consent.

To fulfill contracts or pre-contractual measures and beyond, we process your data (first name, last name, address, telephone number, email) if necessary to protect legitimate interests of ours or third parties, particularly for the following purposes:

* Responding to inquiries
* Technical administration
* Advertising or market and opinion research, provided you have not objected to the use of your data
* Reviewing and optimizing procedures for demand analysis
* Further development of services and products as well as existing systems and processes
* Statistical evaluations or market analysis
* Assertion of legal claims & defense in legal disputes not directly related to the contractual relationship
* Prevention and investigation of criminal offenses, unless exclusively for compliance with legal requirements

The legal bases for data processing are:

* Contract processing according to Art 6 para 1 lit b GDPR
* Your possible consent according to Art 6 para 1 lit a GDPR
* Legitimate interest according to Art 6 para 1 lit f GDPR

## Storage Duration
The deletion of stored personal data occurs when you, as a user of our website and/or customer, revoke the consent to storage, when your data is no longer necessary for the purpose pursued with the storage, and after the expiration of legal retention periods or after the end of any ongoing legal disputes, or when your storage is otherwise unlawful or becomes unlawful.

## Data Transfer / Recipients or Categories of Recipients
Your data will only be transferred to external parties in connection with contract processing, for the purpose of fulfilling legal requirements, where we are obliged to provide information, report, or pass on data, or if the data transfer is in the public interest or you have previously consented.

Personal data will be transferred or disclosed by us to the following designated third parties:

* Various service providers or partner operators that support us in order processing, customer information, advertising, and the provision of services, IT service providers, and technical processors (processors according to Art. 28 GDPR). These operators are obliged to comply with all data protection regulations. Strict data protection regulations apply to order data processing, in particular, these operators may only use the data to fulfill their tasks on our behalf. We are responsible for compliance with data protection regulations by these operators and have concluded corresponding order processing agreements with the service providers
