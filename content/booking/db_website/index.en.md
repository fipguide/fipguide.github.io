**Reservations**

The reservation price is calculated per journey. This means that for connections with transfers, you only need to pay once for multiple trains.

Seat reservations can be purchased via the Deutsche Bahn website. To do so, select the "Book seat only" option in the search. For families with at least one child between 0 and 14 years old, a discounted family reservation is available for €10.30 (2nd class) or €13.00 (1st class). This reservation is valid for up to 5 people and can be selected by specifying the appropriate number of adults and children during the booking process.
