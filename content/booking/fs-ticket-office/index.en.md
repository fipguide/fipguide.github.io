Sometimes tickets at ticket offices are issued at different rates, so prices may vary. However, we are not aware of any resulting problems during ticket inspection on board.

Sometimes the _DIRITTO AMMISSIONE_ fare is sold. Although this does not explicitly refer to FIP, it is accepted. To use it, a FIP Coupon is also required. Use of Business and Executive classes is not permitted with FIP. The correct fare would be _Biglietti Gratuiti FS 1/2 Classe_, which refers to the price difference between regional and long-distance trains. This fare is usually more expensive than _DIRITTO AMMISSIONE_.

**Prices for _DIRITTO AMMISSIONE_:**

Le Frecce: €25 (1st/2nd class) \
InterCity: €3 (1st/2nd class) \
Different prices for long-distance trains to Switzerland/Austria: e.g. €20 Chiasso – Milano (`ECE`/`EC`)

We are not aware of any problems during ticket inspection on board.

{{% highlight tip %}}
For short journeys on Le Frecce and other long-distance trains, the regular fare is cheaper than FIP reduced tickets.

Additionally, supplements for Le Frecce and other long-distance trains can sometimes be more expensive than a FIP 50 Ticket.
