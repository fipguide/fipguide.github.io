Currently, it is not possible to buy FIP 50 tickets or reservations via the BDŽ website. Only regular tickets for domestic travel within Bulgaria can be purchased here, and for reservation-required trains, a reservation is automatically included. If you have a discount card such as a "Railway discount card" or an ISIC student card, you can enter it during booking.
