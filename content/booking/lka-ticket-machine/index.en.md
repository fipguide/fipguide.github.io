At some stations in Poland, ticket machines are available that also sell tickets for ŁKA. Additionally, they can also be found directly on trains on certain routes.

## FIP 50 Tickets

Discounted FIP 50 Tickets can be purchased at the ticket machines. If possible, the discount "FIP (50%)" should be selected. If this is not available, the discount "UMOWA (ulga 50%)" should be selected.

{{% highlight important %}}
In the past, "UMOWA" was not always the correct option for FIP tickets. If in doubt, ask on-site whether this is indeed the correct fare for FIP tickets.
