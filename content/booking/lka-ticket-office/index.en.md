ŁKA operates a small number of its own ticket offices. It is helpful to speak some Polish or have a suitable translation app, as English (or German) is often not widely spoken.

## FIP 50 Tickets

FIP 50 Tickets for ŁKA journeys can be purchased at the ŁKA Ticket Office.

## Reservations

Reservations for ŁS trains can be booked free of charge directly when purchasing a ticket. It is likely that reservations can also be booked on their own, but we cannot guarantee this.
