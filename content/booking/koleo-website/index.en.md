**FIP 50 Tickets**

On the Koleo website, tickets with FIP 50 discount can be purchased online for many railway companies in Poland. To do this, FIP 50 must be added once as a discount in the Koleo customer account [here](https://koleo.pl/de/my/account).

First, you must log into a Koleo account and then switch to settings via the gear icon in the top right.

Then under _My Account / Moje konto_ at _Discount / Zniżka_, add the discount _Międzynarodowa Karta Zniżek FIP (50%)_.

Subsequently, the discounted price is displayed directly in the connection search.

It is recommended to check the price again in a non-logged-in state before purchasing to find out whether the FIP 50 price was actually calculated. With individual railway companies, there have been incorrect price calculations in the past without the FIP 50 discount.
