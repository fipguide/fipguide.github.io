At Transilien ticket offices, discounted FIP tickets for some trains and tram lines in the Greater Paris area can be purchased. You can also collect the _Contremarque de Passage_ (temporary access card) here. This card is required to use the lines with an FIP Coupon. You need a separate card for each journey; see [Trains in Greater Paris]({{< ref "/operator/sncf#züge-im-großraum-paris" >}} "Trains in Greater Paris"). Usually, only a few of these cards are issued at a time per counter.
