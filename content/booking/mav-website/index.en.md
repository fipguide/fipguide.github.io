## FIP 50 Tickets

FIP 50 Tickets for MÁV and GySEV connections are sold on the MÁV booking website. To add the FIP 50 discount, on the connection search page under _Passengers and Discounts_, the passenger overview must be opened. Only after entering the date of birth can the FIP 50 discount be added with _Add Discounts_. A distinction is made between FIP 50 1st class and 2nd class. The class refers to the eligibility, not the desired class of the ticket.
