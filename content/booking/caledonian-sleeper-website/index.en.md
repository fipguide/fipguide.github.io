## Reservations

On the Caledonian Sleeper website, you can purchase Room Supplements (reservations with surcharges for sleeper cars). In addition to the reservation, a valid FIP Coupon for National Rail is required for the day of arrival. When searching for connections, make sure to select the _Room Supplement only_ option.
