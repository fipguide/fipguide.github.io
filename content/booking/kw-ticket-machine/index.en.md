## FIP 50 Tickets

Discounted FIP 50 Tickets can be purchased at the ticket machines. The discount "UMOWA (ulga 50%)" must be selected.

{{% highlight important %}}
In the past, "UMOWA" was not always the correct option for FIP tickets, but at KW there is no other selection available. If in doubt, ask on-site whether this is indeed the correct fare for FIP tickets.
