## FIP 50 Tickets

On the Koleje Śląskie website, you can purchase tickets online with FIP 50 discount for KŚ journeys.

To do this, you must first select a connection and then specify "FIP (50%)" as the discount option when purchasing the ticket. The discount is only applied to standard fares (_LINIOWY RELACJA_). The fare type can be selected in the field next to the discount option. For other fares, a warning is displayed and the booking process checks which ticket is cheapest in the next step.
