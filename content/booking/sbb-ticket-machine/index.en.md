**FIP 50 Tickets**

At SBB ticket machines, FIP 50 tickets can be purchased with the "50% Halbtax" discount, provided it is not a saver ticket, saver day pass, or a special ticket.[^1] This option is actually intended for passengers with a Halbtax subscription (SBB discount card), but is also accepted as a straightforward solution for FIP 50 tickets. The Halbtax price is usually preselected at the machine.

In urban areas, a ticket with Halbtax discount may also include transport operated by companies that do not accept FIP (e.g., trams or buses). These sections cannot be used with FIP, and the purchased ticket is not valid there without a Halbtax subscription.
