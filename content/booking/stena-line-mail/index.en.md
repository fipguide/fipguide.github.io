Booking Stena Line is easy via email. Simply send an email in English or Dutch to [contact.nl@stenaline.com](mailto:contact.nl@stenaline.com). 
The email must contain the following information:

- Travel date and time
- Cabin type (Standard, Superior or Deluxe)
- Name of travellers as stated on their passports
- Passport number and expiry date
- Copy of FIP Card (front and back)

You will usually receive two reply emails from Stena Line. The first email confirms your booking request. The second email provides you with a payment option via pay per link. You will then need to enter your credit card details. 
After payment, you will receive an email with your booking confirmation, which also serves as your ticket – you must of course bring your FIP tickets with you.

Payment via pay per link is only possible on the same day that the corresponding payment request email is received. The link expires at midnight. If this is the case, please contact Stena Line again.
