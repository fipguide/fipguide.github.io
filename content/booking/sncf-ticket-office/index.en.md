SNCF ticket offices are called SNCF Connect Shops and can be found at all major train stations in France. Tickets for domestic and international journeys can be purchased there. The ticket offices often have limited opening hours, so it is recommended to check them before visiting. For travel within France, upgrades from 2nd to 1st class can also be purchased by paying the difference.

If the staff at the ticket office are unsure which fare code to use, you can refer them to the following: [^1]

- FIP Coupon — CF70: Payment only for reservation.
- FIP Coupon — CF71: Upgrade of the FIP Coupon reservation exclusively to 1st class.
- FIP Card active employees (except GB National Rail), retirees — CF52: 50% discount on ticket + mandatory reservation on trains.
- FIP Card active employees (except GB National Rail), retirees — CF54: Upgrade with FIP Card ticket to 1st class + mandatory reservation on trains.
- FIP Card active employees (GB National Rail only) — CF77: 75% discount on ticket + mandatory reservation on trains.
- FIP Card active employees (GB National Rail only) — CF78: Upgrade with FIP Card ticket to 1st class + mandatory reservation on trains.
