SNCF ticket offices are called SNCF Connect Shops and can be found at all major train stations in France. Tickets for domestic and international journeys can be purchased there. The ticket offices often have limited opening hours, so it is recommended to check them before visiting. For travel within France, upgrades from 2nd to 1st class can also be purchased by paying the difference.

If the staff at the ticket office are unsure which fare code to use, you can refer them to the following fare codes:[^1]

**Reservations:**

- FIP Coupon — CF70: Reservation purchase only.
- FIP Coupon — CF71: Upgrade the FIP Coupon reservation to 1st class.

**FIP 50/75 Tickets:**

- FIP Card for active employees and their dependents (except GB National Rail), retirees — CF52: FIP 50 Ticket (50% discount) + mandatory reservation on trains.
