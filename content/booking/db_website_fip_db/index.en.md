**FIP 50 Tickets**

Deutsche Bahn employees can purchase FIP 50 Tickets online for journeys from Germany to neighboring countries. These tickets are available in the DB Travel Market under Rail Offers > Abroad > FIP Offer. The FIP 50 ticket is only valid for the foreign section of the route. This is especially important for DB employees, as FIP 50 Tickets are not valid in your own home country. Therefore, an additional ticket is required for the domestic section within Germany up to the border point.

Booking is only possible via the link in the DB Travel Market. Discounts do not need to be selected; they are applied automatically.

FIP 50 Tickets can be purchased for the following countries:
- Poland
- Austria
- Italy (only Brenner route with Austria)
- Czech Republic
- Switzerland
- Luxembourg
- Denmark
- Netherlands
- Belgium
- France

**Reservations**

The reservation price is calculated per journey. This means that for connections with transfers, you only need to pay once for multiple trains.

Seat reservations can be purchased via the Deutsche Bahn website. To do so, select the "Book seat only" option in the search. For families with at least one child between 0 and 14 years old, a discounted family reservation is available for €10.30 (2nd class) or €13.00 (1st class). This reservation is valid for up to 5 people and can be selected by specifying the appropriate number of adults and children during the booking process.
