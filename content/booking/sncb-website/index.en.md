When using a FIP Coupon for SNCB, CFL, or NS, you can book a cross-border ticket on the website that takes the free travel into account for the Belgian, Luxembourgish, or Dutch section. To do this, select one of the following discounts for the travelers:

- _100% Discount Belgium (SNCB)_
- _100% Discount Luxembourg (CFL)_
- _100% Discount Netherlands (NS)_

This allows you to book cross-border trains from Belgium, for example to Lille in France (except for the `TGV`, which has a Global Fare and is not operated by SNCB), at a very low price. For sections where no discount is selected, the full fare will be charged instead of the FIP 50 fare.
