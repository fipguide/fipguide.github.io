## Reservations

On the Trenitalia website, you can purchase reservations including supplements for the FIP Coupon for Le Frecce and other long-distance trains.

The _DIRITTO AMMISSIONE_ fare can be used for this. Although it is not explicitly for FIP, it is accepted. You will also need a FIP Coupon to use it. Business and Executive class cannot be used with FIP. The correct fare would be _Biglietti Gratuiti FS 1/2 Classe_, which covers the price difference between regional and long-distance trains. This fare is usually more expensive than _DIRITTO AMMISSIONE_, but cannot be purchased online.

**Prices for _DIRITTO AMMISSIONE_:**

Le Frecce: €25 (1st/2nd class) \
InterCity: €3 (1st/2nd class) \
Different prices for long-distance trains towards Switzerland/Austria: e.g. €20 Chiasso – Milano (`ECE`/`EC`)

When booking, you must first select a connection via the journey planner. Then, in the ticket selection, you can choose the _DIRITTO AMMISSIONE_ fare via the _Show more offers_ button. You can enter the number of your FIP Coupon as the access number.
