CFL offers a booking hotline where FIP 50 tickets can be purchased. The hotline is available in Luxembourgish, French, German, and English.

[+352 (0) 2489 2489](tel:+35224892489)

To authenticate FIP eligibility, a photo of the inside of the FIP card for all travelers must be sent by email to [callcenter@cfl.lu](mailto:callcenter@cfl.lu) during the booking process. Payment is then made by credit card via a 15-minute payment link sent by email.

**CFL charges a booking fee of â‚¬5 per booking.**
