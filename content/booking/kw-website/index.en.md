## FIP 50 Tickets

On the Koleje Wielkopolskie website, which is only available in Polish, tickets with FIP 50 discount for KW journeys can be purchased online. First, a connection must be selected, then the discount option "UMOWA (ulga 50%)" must be chosen when purchasing the ticket.

In the past, "UMOWA" was not always the correct option for FIP tickets, but at KW there is no other selection available. If in doubt, ask on-site whether this is indeed the correct fare for FIP tickets.
