**FIP 50 Tickets**

Online FIP 50 Tickets for journeys within Germany and neighboring countries can be booked via Deutsche Bahn. The tickets must include at least one section within Germany. The FIP 50 ticket is issued for the entire route. The ticket is not valid in the country where the FIP ID was issued; an additional ticket is required there.

Booking is only possible via the [link](https://www.bahn.de/buchung/start?KL=2&ET=FIP_SONSTIGE). Discounts do not need to be selected—they are applied automatically.

FIP 50 Tickets can be purchased for the following countries, as long as a section in Germany is included:

- Austria
- Belgium
- Czech Republic
- Denmark
- France
- Germany
- Italy (only Brenner route with Austria)
- Luxembourg
- Netherlands
- Poland
- Switzerland

**Reservations**

The reservation price is charged per journey. For connections with transfers, you only pay once for multiple trains.

Seat reservations can be purchased via the Deutsche Bahn website. To do so, select the "Seat reservation only" option in the search. For families with at least one child between 0 and 14 years old, a discounted family reservation can be purchased for €10.30 (2nd class) or €13.00 (1st class). This is valid for up to 5 people and can be selected by specifying the appropriate number of adults and children during the booking process.
