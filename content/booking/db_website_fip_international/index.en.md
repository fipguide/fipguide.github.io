**FIP 50 Tickets**

Online FIP 50 Tickets for journeys within Germany and neighboring countries can be booked via Deutsche Bahn. The tickets must include at least one section within Germany. The FIP 50 ticket is issued for the entire route. The ticket is not valid in the country where the FIP ID was issued; an additional ticket is required there.

Booking is only possible via the [link](https://www.bahn.de/buchung/start?KL=2&ET=FIP_SONSTIGE). Discounts do not need to be selected—they are applied automatically.

FIP 50 Tickets can be purchased for the following countries, as long as a section in Germany is included:

- Austria
- Belgium
- Czech Republic
- Denmark
- France
- Germany
- Italy (only Brenner route with Austria)
- Luxembourg
- Netherlands
- Poland
- Switzerland
