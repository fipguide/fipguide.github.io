**Reservations**

The reservation price is calculated per train. For journeys with multiple trains, it may be cheaper to book through the ([Deutsche Bahn]({{% ref "/booking/db_website" %}} "Deutsche Bahn")).

However, seat reservations made via ÖBB can be cancelled:

- 180 days to 15 days before departure: 100% of the reservation price
- 14 days to 1 day before departure: 50% of the reservation price

On the ÖBB website, to book a reservation, select the option "Nur Sitzplatzreservierung - Ich habe schon ein Ticket" ("Seat reservation only - I already have a ticket").
