## What is FIP?

FIP stands for _Groupement pour les facilit√©s de circulation internationales du personnel des chemins de fer_. It is the association for international travel concessions for railway personnel.
With this international discount card for railway personnel, employees can use trains, ships, and buses in Europe at reduced rates.
This project provides information and usage instructions for FIP as well as specifics about the participating railway companies.

## What discounts do I get through FIP?

There are two ways to use it:
1. **FIP Card:** The FIP Card is valid for three years and entitles the holder to unlimited purchase of discounted train tickets abroad.
2. **FIP Coupons:** Each year, FIP members can receive FIP Coupons, which allow for up to eight days of travel.

You can find the exact regulations on the subpages of the [operators]({{< ref "operator" >}}).

## How can I take advantage of FIP?

Employees of a FIP member are eligible to use FIP facilities after 12 months of employment.
Please contact your HR department for application and usage.

## Who is behind the FIP Guide?
