With the FIP Card, you are entitled to use the transport services of the respective FIP member at discounted rates.
Different rules apply depending on the operator. You can find details on the [operator pages](operator).

There are various types of discounts:

1. **Discounted tickets:** With the FIP Card, you receive heavily discounted tickets (usually 50% off the flexible price or global fare). There are no quantity restrictions or application deadlines.
2. **Free travel with FIP Coupons:** With many FIP members, you can travel for free with an FIP Coupon. Per operator, one coupon with one to four fields can be ordered once per calendar year.

FIP travel is not always the cheapest option. In some countries, savings fares are available that are cheaper.
