## Ticket and Reservation Purchase

### Online

- [ZSSK Website](https://www.zssk.sk):  
  **Reservation:** ✅  
  In the connection search, you can select "I have the ticket already I want to purchase only reservation or additional service" on the English website. Then choose "Reservation" and select "International ticket/Rail Pass" as the discount in the passenger selection, ensuring "Entitled for 100% discount" is selected.  
  **FIP 50 tickets:** ⛔
- Other options:  
  Reservations are also possible via the websites of [CD](https://www.cd.cz), [DB](https://www.bahn.de), and [ÖBB](https://www.oebb.at) at partially different prices. IC and SC trains are excluded.

### On-site

- ZSR ticket counters:  
  In Slovakia, there is a comprehensive network of ticket counters even at smaller stations. It is advantageous to speak some Slovak or Czech or have the appropriate translator app, as English (or German) is often not widely spoken.  
  **Reservation:** ✅  
  **FIP 50 tickets:** ✅
- Other options:  
  FIP 50 tickets and reservations can also be purchased at CD, DB, and ÖBB travel centers.

### On the train

If no ticket counter is available or open, a ticket (or reservation in Ex) can be purchased on board the train from the conductor if approached immediately.[^1]

## Arrival and Border Points

### Czech Republic

From the Czech Republic, cross-border trains of Ceske Drahy or ZSSK can be used on various routes. An additional FIP 50 ticket or FIP free travel pass of Ceske Drahy is required. Cross-border trains of RegioJet cannot be used with FIP.

## Discounts

Children up to 6 years travel free on ZSSK trains when accompanied by a person aged at least 16 years. In 1st class, this is limited to 2 children; from the 3rd child, 50% of the ticket price is due. In EC trains, an additional 1 € per child is charged in 1st class from the 3rd child. In SC trains, 1 € per child is always charged in 2nd class and 3 € in 1st class. In IC trains, a reservation including a surcharge for the train category must be purchased per child.[^1]

Children between 6 and 16 years, regardless of nationality, have the opportunity to get free travel with ZSSK. However, this involves some effort. The following is required:

- Photo (2x3cm) of the child
- ID of the child (if no ID is available, the combination of the child's birth certificate and the guardian's ID is also possible)

This must be presented by the guardian at a ticket counter. Depending on the system available at the counter, registration can either be done immediately or take up to 3 working days. In the end, you get a confirmation that must always be carried on the trains. Additionally, a ticket must still be booked via the [ZSSK website](https://www.zssk.sk/) by selecting the appropriate travel group (Important: "Entitled for 100% discount" must be selected) for 0 euros. In EC trains, an additional reservation fee of 1 € is added, in SC trains 5 €. IC trains and RJ trains cannot be used.[^1]
Without all the effort, children between 6 and 16 years can travel with a 50% discount. This also allows the use of IC trains with a 1 € fee, in SC trains 1 € in 2nd class and 3 € in 1st class. An official document with a photo, age, date of birth, and (if possible) birth number must be carried.[^1]  
For children over 16 years, there is no discount, but students under 26 years and pensioners from 62 years from the EU (as well as students from all over the world studying in Slovakia) can also get free travel, similar to children between 6 and 16 years. Since this is not directly related to FIP, we refer to the page [ZSSK Zero Fare](https://www.zssk.sk/en/zero-fare/).

## Special Tariff Conditions

A break in the journey is only possible for distances of 101 km and more.

Buses are excluded from FIP discounts unless they replace a train where FIP would have been recognized (rail replacement service).[^1]

### InterCity Vienna - Bratislava - Košice

For the InterCity Vienna - Košice, the FIP free travel pass for ZSR is sufficient for the entire route (also in Austria).[^1]
