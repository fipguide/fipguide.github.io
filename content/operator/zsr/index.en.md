### On the train

If no ticket counter is available or open, a ticket (or reservation in Ex) can be purchased on board the train from the conductor if approached immediately.[^1]

## Discounts

Children up to 6 years travel free on ZSSK trains when accompanied by a person aged at least 16 years. In 1st class, this is limited to 2 children; from the 3rd child, 50% of the ticket price is due. In `EC` trains, an additional 1€ per child is charged in 1st class from the 3rd child. In SC trains, 1€ per child is always charged in 2nd class and 3€ in 1st class. In IC trains, a reservation including a surcharge for the train category must be purchased for each child.[^1]

Children between 6 and 16 years, regardless of nationality, have the opportunity to get free travel with ZSSK. However, this involves some effort. The following is required:

- Photo (2x3cm) of the child
- ID of the child (if no ID is available, the combination of the child's birth certificate and the ID of the guardian is also possible)

This must be presented by the guardian at a ticket counter. Depending on the system available at the counter, registration can either be done immediately or take up to 3 working days. In the end, you get a confirmation that must always be carried on the trains. Additionally, a ticket is still required, which can be booked for 0 euros on the [ZSSK website](https://www.zssk.sk/) by selecting the appropriate travel group (Important: "Entitled for 100% discount" must be selected). For `EC` trains, an additional reservation fee of 1€ is added, for `SC` trains 5€. `IC` trains and `RJ` trains cannot be used.[^1]
Without all the effort, children between 6 and 16 years can travel with a 50% discount. This also allows the use of `IC` trains with a 1€ fee, in `SC` trains 1€ in 2nd class and 3€ in 1st class. An official document with a photo, age, date of birth, and (if possible) birth number must be carried.[^1] \
For children over 16 years, there is no discount, but it is possible for students under 26 years and pensioners from 62 years from the EU (as well as students from all over the world studying in Slovakia) to also get free travel, similar to children between 6 and 16 years. Since this is not directly related to FIP, we refer to the page [ZSSK Zero Fare](https://www.zssk.sk/en/zero-fare/).

## Special Tariff Conditions

### D trains to Vienna

`D` trains between Bratislava and Vienna can be used on the entire route (including the Austrian section) with ZSSK FIP coupons. Alternatively, ÖBB FIP coupons are also valid on the Austrian section.

### Break in the journey

### Busses and replacement services
Buses are excluded from FIP discounts, except when they replace a train where FIP would have been recognized (rail replacement service).[^1]
