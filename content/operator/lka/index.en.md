## Train Categories and Reservations

ŁKA distinguishes two train categories:

{{% train-category
    id="ls"
    title="ŁKA Sprinter (ŁS)"
    type="regional"
    fip_accepted=true
    reservation_required=false
    reservation_possible=true
%}}

Regional trains operating between Łódź and Warsaw, stopping at only a few stations along the way. Some trains only stop at the most important stations of the two cities and not at all in between. Trains have the abbreviation `ŁS` at the beginning in journey planners followed by a specific train number.

#### Reservation

A free reservation is possible on these trains. However, they can also be used without a reservation. More information on the [ŁKA website in Polish](https://lka.lodzkie.pl/strona-glowna/Nowe-zasady-rezerwacji-miejsc-w-Sprinterach/). Only 2nd class tickets are offered, as there is no 1st class on ŁKA trains.

### On the Train

FIP 50 Tickets can also be purchased directly on the train. To do this, you must contact the train staff immediately after boarding. When boarding at stations that also have a ticket office or ticket machine, a surcharge for issuing the ticket on the train may be added to the ticket price. Tickets can be paid for in cash or by contactless credit card. Payment is only possible in the local currency, zloty. Reservations for `ŁS` trains can also be obtained here spontaneously free of charge, subject to seat availability. [^2]

## Discounts

For regular tickets, children under 4 years travel free. Children up to and including 11 years receive a 50% discount on the adult fare. From age 12, the full adult fare applies. [^1]

Regardless of FIP, Polregio offers an affordable weekend ticket which, in the form of "BILET TURYSTYCZNY", is also valid on regular ŁKA trains. It allows travel from Friday 18:00 to Monday 06:00 on all "Regio" trains of Polregio as well as all trains of KW, KMŁ, Arriva RP and ŁKA (except ŁKA Sprinter). More information on the [Polregio website](https://bilety.polregio.pl/en/sieciowe/47).

## Special Tariff Conditions

### Special Trains

FIP tickets are not valid on special trains operated by ŁKA.

### Break of Journey

Breaks of journey are possible at any time; no documentation is required for this.

### Buses

We currently have no information about the validity of FIP tickets on buses operated by ŁKA. However, we assume that at least the buses that replace a train can be used with FIP benefits.

## Recommendations

{{% highlight tip %}}
In addition to many connections in the Łódź area, ŁKA also offers interregional direct connections from Łódź to Poznań or Warsaw. This means that a large distance within Poland can be covered with an ŁKA FIP Coupon, without simultaneously having a PKP FIP Coupon. However, it should be noted that on many ŁKA routes, trains from PKP InterCity and Polregio also operate in parallel.

On its website, ŁKA offers a [live map](https://infoportal.lka.lodzkie.pl/#!/) of its trains.
