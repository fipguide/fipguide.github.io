Koleje Dolnośląskie (KD) is a Polish railway company offering regional services in the Lower Silesia Province. It is one of five different operators in [Poland](/country/poland) which provide FIP benefits.

On their website, KD provides an [overview map of the routes](https://kolejedolnoslaskie.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Schemat-UMWD-2025-2026-1.1.pdf).

## Summary

- KD accepts FIP Coupon and FIP 50 Tickets (as per glossary).
- Only 2nd class is available in KD trains and reservations are not possible.
- Some special trains are excluded from FIP.

## Validity of FIP Tickets

FIP Coupon: ✅ \
FIP Coupon for relatives: ⛔ \
FIP 50 Tickets: ✅

FIP Coupons and FIP 50 Tickets are valid on KD.

For cross-border journeys, either a continuous FIP 50 Ticket or FIP Coupons from both operators in the two countries are required. An exception applies between Zgorzelec and Görlitz (Cologne is not referenced here, but would be Cologne elsewhere); on this short section, no additional ticket is needed. (see [Trains between Zgorzelec and Görlitz](#trains-between-zgorzelec-and-görlitz))

## Train Categories and Reservations

KD does not distinguish different train categories. Its trains usually have a line number beginning with "D". In many journey planners, only “KD” and a train number are given. Some trains are marketed as "KD Sprinter" or "KD Supersprinter" but remain regional trains. Only 2nd class tickets are offered as there is no 1st class on KD trains. There are no reservation facilities.

### On the Train

FIP 50 Tickets can also be purchased on the train without surcharge. After boarding, contact the conductor immediately. Tickets can be paid for in cash or by contactless credit card (Visa, Visa Electron, V Pay, Mastercard, Maestro). Payment is only possible in Polish zloty.[^1]

## Discounts

For regular tickets, children under 4 years travel for free. Children up to and including 11 years receive a 50% discount on the adult fare. From age 12, the full adult fare applies.[^1]

Regardless of FIP, a special weekend ticket is available for Lower Silesia, allowing all regional trains to be used from Friday 18:00 to Monday 06:00. More information on the [KD website](https://kolejedolnoslaskie.pl/oferty-taryfowe/dolnoslaski-bilet-weekendowy/).

## Special Tariff Conditions

### Special trains

There are a few "KD Specjal" trains that operate outside of the regular timetable. FIP benefits are not valid on these trains.

In the summer season, KD also operates special "KD Premium" trains running from Wrocław to Świnoujście on the Baltic Sea, beyond Lower Silesia. These trains cannot be used with FIP. They are clearly marked with special fare conditions in journey planners.

### Trains between Zgorzelec and Görlitz

Normally, KD FIP benefits are only valid in Poland. An exception applies for cross-border travel between Zgorzelec (Poland) and Görlitz (Germany). No extra ticket is needed between the two stations; all tickets valid to Zgorzelec are also valid to Görlitz and vice versa.

### Buses

FIP is also valid on all KD bus routes, which usually operate as rail replacement services or as preliminary routes for lines that will soon be reopened for rail traffic.

## Recommendations

{{% highlight tip %}}
Using FIP with KD is generally simple and convenient with very few exceptions. The Lower Silesia region can be easily explored by train. In recent years, KD has reactivated some dormant lines, making them fit for modern service. For example, the line to Karpacz in the Giant Mountains, after 25 years of closure, is now operated regularly since summer 2025. More reactivations are planned. Especially on electrified routes, the trains are very modern and comfortable. On non-electrified lines, trains can become very crowded because only small railcars are used.
