## Summary

## Validity of FIP Tickets

FIP Coupon: ✅ \
FIP Coupon for Relatives: ⛔ \
FIP 50 Tickets: ✅

{{< highlight important >}}
Luxembourg offers free public transport for domestic journeys regardless of FIP. This includes all train services (except TGV), trams, and buses. Travel with CFL is therefore free of charge in second class and no additional ticket is required. Travel in first class requires a FIP Coupon or FIP 50 Ticket for first class. For journeys beyond Luxembourg, e.g. towards Germany or Belgium, a ticket from the border point is required. This means that, for example, a through ticket, a valid FIP Coupon, or a national travel concession is needed for journeys to Germany to travel into the neighboring country. A ticket from the first station after the border is not sufficient.

## Ticket and Reservation Purchase

Ticket purchase is only relevant for first class.

{{% highlight tip %}}
CFL offers affordable ticket options for first class starting from €3. These tickets are not route-dependent but are valid for a certain period for the entire network. These tickets can (e.g. due to booking fees) be cheaper than FIP 50 Tickets for first class. More information on the [CFL website](https://www.cfl.lu/en-gb/ticket/national)
