## Recommendations

{{% highlight tip %}}
DSB offers reliable and comfortable service. The 1st class is particularly worthwhile for FIP journeys in Denmark, as it provides complimentary tea, coffee, water, and snacks at all times, and often a small breakfast in the morning. It also grants access to the DSB Lounge in Copenhagen, Odense, and Aarhus. Additionally, a free drink (coffee, tea, water) can be obtained at 7/11 at the station. [^2]
