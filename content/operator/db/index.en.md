### On the Train

FIP 50 Tickets cannot be purchased on the train.

## Discounts

For public fares, children up to 6 years travel free, children between 6 and 14 years receive a 50% discount on the adult fare. From 14 years, the regular adult fare applies.

### Children Traveling Free

Accompanying children aged 6 to 14 may travel free with a FIP holder, provided

- the FIP holder is at least 15 years old and
- has a valid ticket (e.g., FIP 50 Ticket) or a FIP Coupon.[^1]

Children traveling free do not need to be related to the accompanying adult.

Up to 3 children can be taken on local trains and up to 4 children on long-distance trains. For FIP 50 Tickets that include a long-distance section, up to 4 children can also be taken on the specified local trains.

Children traveling free do not need to be entered on the ticket. For FIP 50 Tickets, it is still recommended to book them free of charge to avoid problems during ticket inspection.

Children not accompanied by a person over 15 years old with travel entitlement must purchase their own ticket.

Children under 6 years always travel free and do not need their own ticket.

## Special Tariff Conditions

### Nordhessischer Verkehrsverbund (NVV)

In the Nordhessischer Verkehrsverbund (NVV), no discounts for DB employees are recognized in regional transport. Therefore, no FIP discounts apply here.
A [map](https://www.nvv.de/fileadmin/nvv/data/2._Fahrtinfo/4._Liniennetz/Liniennetz_Nordhessen_Schematisch.pdf) of the affected regional train lines is available.

### Journeys in Transport Associations

Germany is divided into so-called _Verkehrsverbünde_ (combined tariff structure). These are public organizations that organize local transport in the respective region across all operators. They are also responsible for ticket prices and tariffs. Travel with FIP discounts within a single transport association is generally not permitted. A journey must always cover at least two transport associations, as in this case tariffs and tickets from operators may be offered. There may be exceptions, which can be checked with the respective transport association or local ticket offices. [^1]

For FIP 50 Tickets, the departure and destination stations must be in different transport associations. This also applies to journeys with FIP Coupon.

{{% highlight tip %}}
An overview of all transport associations is available on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_German_tariff_and_transport_associations).

As a rough guide, you can also check in DB Navigator or on the [DB website](https://bahn.de) whether association tickets are sold for a route. These are marked as _Verbund-Angebote_, with the logo and under offers of \[association name\].
{{% /highlight %}}

{{% expander "Example for Transport Associations on Bahn.de" info %}}
In the following example, the selected connection is within the transport association _VRS_:

### Tariff Distinction between Local and Long-Distance Transport

With FIP 50 Tickets, you can flexibly use trains on the same route. However, you must pay attention to the train categories, as DB distinguishes between tickets for different train categories (so-called [_product classes_](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preissystem_der_Deutschen_Bahn#Produktklassen)). Tickets (including FIP 50 Tickets) are only valid in the same or lower product classes. The product class is indicated on the ticket (e.g., _ICE Fahrkarte_ or _IC/EC Fahrkarte_) and is based on the highest train category on the booked connection.

The following product classes exist:

- Product class ICE (formerly product class A): \
  ICE, ICE Sprinter, TGV, RJ, RJX, ECE
- Product class IC/EC (formerly product class B): \
  IC, EC, D, EN, NJ
- Product class C: \
  IRE, RE, FEX, MEX, RB, S

### DB Syltshuttle

DB operates the car train _Syltshuttle_, which runs from Niebüll car loading to Westerland (Sylt) car loading. Travel is only possible with a vehicle (car, caravan, motorhome) and requires a [separate ticket](https://ticket.syltshuttle.de/). FIP discounts are not recognized.

### Shipping and Wangerooge Island Railway

FIP Coupons are valid on Ferry services between Harlesiel pier and Wangerooge and Wangerooge Island Railway. FIP 50 Tickets cannot be booked.

### Regionalverkehre Start GmbH

Regionalverkehre Start GmbH is a subsidiary of DB Regio AG but does not accept FIP discounts.

### Buses and Replacement Transport

Buses are excluded from FIP discounts, except when they replace a train where FIP would have been recognized (rail replacement service).[^1]

## Recommendations

Deutsche Bahn operates a wide variety of connections. For example, you can use the Thuringian Mountain Railway from Obstfelderschmiede to Cursdorf. Connections through the Black Forest (Black Forest Railway) or along the left Rhine route are also highly recommended. In long-distance transport, a highlight is that there is usually a restaurant car on every ´ICE´ connection. Although the food is not freshly cooked, the dishes are still very varied.
