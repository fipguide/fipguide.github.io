## Class Categories

There is only one class on the ships with regard to FIP.

When booking a cabin, you can choose between Standard, Superior, and Deluxe options. [^3]
No FIP discount is granted on cabins. [^2]

## Ticket and Reservation Purchase

FIP tickets must be purchased before the journey. Purchase on board the ships is not possible.
FIP only grants a discount on the fare; all additional services are charged at full price. These include, among others, cabin reservation costs, vehicle transport, as well as port fees and environmental charges.
With a FIP Coupon, the fare is free of charge.
Generally, the overnight crossing is more expensive than the day crossing. This is because the fare is higher at night and cabin reservation is mandatory.[^4]

## Recommendations

Arrival at the station _Hoek van Holland Haven_ is usually via Metro Line B from Rotterdam and Schiedam.

- Station _Schiedam Centrum_: direct transfer to `IC` and `RE` trains of NS.
- Station _Rotterdam Centraal_: transfer options to NS trains. To reach Hoek van Holland, change from Metro Line D at station _Beurs_.

{{% highlight important %}}
RET N.V. does not accept FIP, so a regular ticket must be purchased for the metro ride. This also works contactless and with ApplePay.

In Harwich, there is a connection at _Harwich International_ station to Greater Anglia trains to/from London.

{{% highlight tip %}}
Stena Line offers a great way to be in London before 10 am if you invest a little more time the day before. The afternoon can be spent in Rotterdam or at the nearby beach, which is only one metro stop away. If you are in a hurry, you should change at Schiedam Centrum station.
