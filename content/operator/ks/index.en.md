FIP Coupons and FIP 50 Tickets are valid with KŚ.

For cross-border journeys, either a continuous FIP 50 Ticket or FIP Coupons from both operators in the two countries must be available. For journeys with different operators within Poland, either a continuous FIP 50 Ticket or FIP Coupons from both operators must be available.

## Train Categories and Reservations

KŚ does not distinguish different train categories. Trains usually have a line number starting with "S", which is often not provided in information systems (here it often just says "KŚ" followed by a train number). Only 2nd class tickets are offered, as there is no 1st class on KŚ trains. Additionally, no reservations are possible.

## Recommendations

Similar to other regional railway companies in Poland that accept FIP, using FIP with KŚ is simple and convenient with few exceptions. The Polish metropolitan region around Katowice can thus be easily accessed via regional transport. Fans of the railway company can also obtain merchandise at the KŚ travel center at Katowice train station.
