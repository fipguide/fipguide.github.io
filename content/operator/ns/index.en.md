### Ticket Barriers at Stations

With the FIP Coupon, you receive an NS gate-pass coupon with a barcode to open the gates at NS stations. This is a gate-pass, not a ticket. It is valid for use on 8 separate days (00:00 to 23:59) within a period of 3 months from the first day of use. The first use at a gate sets the start date. Within a day:

- You can check in and out 6 times at the same station.
- You can check in and out a total of 12 times nationwide.

If needed, a new gate-pass coupon can be requested at the NS ticket counter.

## Recommendations

{{% highlight tip %}}
NS impresses with a dense schedule and good connections. Delays and cancellations do occur, but due to the high frequency, they are often not too problematic. Nevertheless, you should not plan with tight connections, as trains rarely wait for each other. The 1st class in NS trains is often not much more comfortable than 2nd class.
