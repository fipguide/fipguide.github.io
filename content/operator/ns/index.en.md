## Arrival and Border Points

### Germany

From Germany, the cross-border ICE from Frankfurt / Cologne / D√ºsseldorf can be used to enter the NS network. For cross-border journeys, an additional DB ticket is required. There are also various regional trains, but only two are valid with FIP: the connections from Dortmund to Enschede and M√ºnster to Enschede. Here, DB Regio operates on the German section. With an additional ticket for the German section of DB, you are covered. On the RE routes Hamm - Venlo and D√ºsseldorf - Arnhem, the Deutschlandticket is valid for the entire route. If you have this ticket, you can also enter the Netherlands.

### Belgium

From Belgium, cross-border regional trains (including the IC here) can be used, but an additional FIP ticket from SNCB is required. There are also long-distance trains (ECD and EC), where an additional supplement may be required when traveling on the Rotterdam - Schiphol axis. With the Eurostar (formerly Thalys), you can also reach the SNCB network from the Netherlands. Here, a special FIP ticket from Eurostar is required for the entire route (including within the Netherlands). ([see Eurostar]({{% ref "/operator/eurostar" %}} "Eurostar"))

## Special Tariff Conditions

### Ticket Barriers at Stations

With the FIP Coupon, you receive an NS gate-pass coupon with a barcode to open the gates at NS stations. This is a gate-pass, not a ticket. It is valid for use on 8 separate days (00:00 to 23:59) within a period of 3 months from the first day of use. The first use at a gate sets the start date. Within a day:

- You can check in and out 6 times at the same station.
- You can check in and out a total of 12 times nationwide.

If needed, a new gate-pass coupon can be requested at the NS ticket counter.

## Experiences

{{% highlight inofficial %}}
NS impresses with a dense schedule and good connections. Delays and cancellations do occur, but due to the high frequency, they are often not too problematic. Nevertheless, you should not plan with tight connections, as trains rarely wait for each other. The 1st class in NS trains is often not much more comfortable than 2nd class.
