### Bernina Express

The Bernina Express is another well-known panoramic train in Switzerland. It runs on the route between Chur and Tirano in Italy and is operated exclusively by the Rhaetian Railway (RhB). In the summer season, more than one connection per day is offered.

SP FIP Coupons and FIP 50 Tickets are valid on this train, but only with an additional paid seat reservation. This can be booked via the [Bernina Express website](https://tickets.rhb.ch/de/routing/bernina-express) and should be made well in advance, as trains can sell out quickly.

As an alternative to the Bernina Express (marked as `PE` in timetables), other services are available on the route for which no reservation is required.

### Treno Panoramico Vigezzo Vision

The Treno Panoramico Vigezzo Vision runs on the route Domodossola – Càmedo – Locarno and is jointly operated by Ferrovie Autolinee Regionali Ticinesi (FART) and Società Subalpina di Imprese Ferroviarie (SSIF).

SP FIP Coupons and FIP 50 Tickets are valid on this train, but only with an additional paid seat reservation. This can be booked via [this link](https://prenota.vigezzinacentovalli.com/).

### Pilatusbahn

Pilatusbahn is not a member of FIP, but currently still offers a 50% discount on tickets upon presentation of the FIP Card when purchased at a Pilatusbahn ticket counter.

This special offer can be withdrawn by Pilatusbahn at any time.

## Recommendations

{{% highlight tip %}}
With SP FIP discounts, many internationally known trains within Switzerland and even beyond can be used. Even though some railways have a few restrictions or special rules, the Coupon is particularly worthwhile here. Highly recommended are, for example, the routes of the Rhaetian Railway (RhB), e.g., to St. Moritz, or the GoldenPass Panoramic of MOB. For particularly impressive mountain panoramas, the Rigi Bahnen (RB), which goes up to the summit of the Rigi, or the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn (MGB), from which the Matterhorn can be admired especially well, are ideal.

When traveling with a Coupon, it is advisable, if possible, also to have the Coupons of SBB and BLS. With all three in combination, Switzerland can be traveled very well and easily. This way both the main routes for getting from one place to another and the particularly beautiful tourist routes can be explored.
