### On the Train

FIP 50 Tickets can also be purchased directly on the train. To do this, you must contact the train staff immediately after boarding. When boarding at stations that also have a ticket office or ticket machine, a surcharge for issuing the ticket on the train may be added to the ticket price. Tickets can be paid for in cash or by contactless credit card. Payment is only possible in the local currency, zloty.

## Discounts

For regular tickets, children under 4 years travel free. Children up to and including 11 years receive a 50% discount on the adult fare. From age 12, the full adult fare applies.[^1]

Regardless of FIP, Polregio offers an affordable weekend ticket which, in the form of "BILET TURYSTYCZNY", is also valid on KW trains. It allows travel from Friday 18:00 to Monday 06:00 on all "Regio" trains of Polregio as well as all trains of KW, KMŁ, Arriva RP and ŁKA (except ŁKA Sprinter). More information on the [Polregio website](https://bilety.polregio.pl/en/sieciowe/47).

## Special Tariff Conditions

### Special Trains

FIP tickets are not valid on special trains operated by KW.

### Break of Journey

Breaks of journey are possible at any time; no documentation is required for this.

### Buses

FIP tickets are only valid on KW buses that operate as a replacement service for a train.

## Recommendations

{{% highlight tip %}}
Similar to other regional railway companies in Poland that accept FIP, using FIP with KW is simple and convenient with few exceptions. However, on many routes, trains from PKP InterCity and Polregio also operate, which means that having an additional PKP FIP Coupon is very helpful when using a FIP Coupon, in order not to be too restricted in train choice.
