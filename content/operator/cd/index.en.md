### ČD Commercial Services

On so-called _commercial_ ČD services, a supplement must be purchased at the ČD ticket office before travel. These mainly operate on the Prague – Ostrava route.

Overview of services: [ČD commercial trains and selected lines 2024-2025](https://www.raildeliverygroup.com/images/RST/CD%20kommerzielle%20Zuge%20und%20ausgewahlte%20Linien%202024-2025.pdf)

If an unused supplement is returned by 08:00 on the first day of validity, a handling fee of 100 CZK is charged. In all other cases, no refund is possible. [^1]

### ČD Services without FIP

In principle, FIP is theoretically not valid on ČD trains operated under public service contracts. Unfortunately, ČD does not provide a complete list. The most important are:

#### Regional trains in the South Moravia region (Brno)

FIP tickets are not valid on regional trains in South Moravia, even if operated by ČD.

#### Regional trains in the Pilsen region

FIP tickets are not valid on some regional trains in the Pilsen area.

### Buses and Replacement Services

FIP Coupons are not valid on buses operated by ČD, except for rail replacement services.

For some connections, discounted tickets are available:

- Václav Havel Airport Prague – Praha hl. n. (Prague Main Station)
- Hranice na Moravĕ – Nový Jičin – Příbor – Frýdek-Místek

No FIP discounts apply on other connections.

A ticket (reservation required) must be purchased at least 15 minutes before departure at a ČD ticket office, ticket machine (no FIP available), or in the ČD eShop (no FIP available).

### Cable Cars

FIP discounts are not valid on cable cars operated by ČD.

### Special Trains and Historic Services

FIP discounts are not valid on special trains and historic services operated by ČD.

### Foreign Section (Děčín – Rumburk)

FIP tickets are valid on the through routes 083 and 098 (Děčín – Rumburk via Dolní Žleb and Dolní Poustevna and back) even for journeys that leave and re-enter Czechia. However, boarding or alighting at an international station is not permitted.

### Journey Interruption

A journey interruption is not permitted on domestic journeys up to 100 km. For journeys of 101 km or more, interruption is possible (but not at an international station).

## Recommendations

{{% highlight tip %}}
České dráhy enjoys a good reputation among passengers for reliable and mostly comfortable travel with very good service. Railway staff are usually very friendly and helpful. Connections often wait in case of delays, except at major hubs like Praha hl. n. Using the ČD app ("Můj vlak") is highly recommended, as it provides live data, coach compositions, and other important information.
