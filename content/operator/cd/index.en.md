### On the Train

FIP-discounted tickets can only be purchased on the train if departure is from a station where the ticket office is closed.

## Discounts

For regular tickets, children up to 6 years travel free in 2nd class. Children up to 18 years receive a 50% discount on the adult fare. Persons aged 18 and over pay the full adult fare.

## Special Tariff Conditions

### ČD Commercial Services

On so-called _commercial_ ČD services, a surcharge must be purchased at a ČD Ticket Office before departure. These operate primarily on the Prague – Ostrava route and apply only to trains of categories `SC`, `IC`, and `Ex`.

Overview of services: [ČD commercial trains and selected lines 2024-2025](https://www.raildeliverygroup.com/images/RST/CD%20kommerzielle%20Zuge%20und%20ausgewahlte%20Linien%202024-2025.pdf)

Refunds of supplements are possible until 23:59 on the day before the first day of validity (without deduction) or within 15 minutes of purchase (without deduction). If an unused supplement is returned by 08:00 on the first day of validity, a handling fee of 100 CZK is charged. In all other cases, no refund is possible. [^1]

### ČD Services without FIP

In principle, FIP does not apply on ČD trains that operate as part of public tenders awarded to ČD, unless at least a section of the service was awarded directly by the Ministry of Transport. For overregional connections, these are excluded as [ČD Commercial Services](#čd-commercial-services). Trains of categories `R`, `EC`, and `RJ` are generally not affected and can always be used with FIP.

For services awarded by regional municipalities (trains of categories `SP` and `OS`), ČD does not provide a complete list; in case of doubt, ask ČD support or a ČD ticket office. The most important ones are the following:

#### Regional trains in the South Moravia region (Brno)

FIP Tickets are not valid on regional trains in South Moravia, even if operated by ČD.

#### Regional trains in the Pilsen region

FIP Tickets are not valid on some regional trains in the Pilsen area.

Overview of services: [ČD Pilsen region exclusion list 2024-2025](https://www.raildeliverygroup.com/images/RST/Sperrliste%20CD%20Region%20Pilsen%202024%20-%202025.pdf)

### Buses and Replacement Services

FIP Coupons are not valid on buses operated by ČD, except for rail replacement services.

For some connections, discounted tickets are available:

- Václav Havel Airport Prague – Praha hl. n. (Prague Main Station)
- Hranice na Moravĕ – Nový Jičin – Příbor – Frýdek-Místek

No FIP discounts apply on other connections.

A ticket (reservation required) must be purchased at least 15 minutes before departure at a ČD ticket office, ticket machine (no FIP available), or in the ČD eShop (no FIP available).

### Cable Cars

FIP discounts are not valid on cable cars operated by ČD.

### Special Trains and Historic Services

FIP discounts are not valid on special trains and historic services operated by ČD.

### Foreign Section (Děčín – Rumburk)

FIP Tickets are valid on the through routes 083 and 098 (Děčín – Rumburk via Dolní Žleb and Dolní Poustevna and back) even for journeys that leave and re-enter Czechia. However, boarding or alighting at an international station is not permitted.

### Journey Interruption

A journey interruption is not permitted on domestic journeys up to 100 km. For journeys of 101 km or more, interruption is possible (but not at an international station).

## Recommendations

The ČD Lounges in Praha hl. n., Olomouc hl. n., Břeclav, and Brno hl. n. can be used with a first-class FIP 50 Ticket or a FIP Coupon. They can also be accessed with a second-class ticket in combination with a seat reservation. [^2]

{{% highlight tip %}}
České dráhy enjoys a good reputation among passengers for reliable and mostly comfortable travel with very good service. Railway staff are usually very friendly and helpful. Connections often wait in case of delays, except at major hubs like Praha hl. n. Using the ČD app ("Můj vlak") is highly recommended, as it provides live data, coach compositions, and other important information.
