If no staff is visible, passengers should wait in the first compartment. Otherwise, the passenger is considered to be traveling without a valid ticket and must expect an increased transport fee.

#### PKP Szybka Koleje Miejska w Trójmieśce (SKM)

A passenger who has not purchased a ticket before departure is obliged to report immediately after boarding to the conductor or ticket inspector to buy a ticket. For this, the passenger must use the front door of the train (in the direction of travel) and, if the staff is not in this part of the train, wait there for the staff.

Issuing a ticket on the train is subject to a fee. The amount of the fee can be found in the tariff online at [www.skm.pkp.pl](https://www.skm.pkp.pl/) (C-PKP SKM).

## Recommendations

{{% highlight tip %}}
FIP Coupons for 1st class are only conditionally worthwhile with PKP. If journeys with the EIP are planned, they are recommended due to the increased comfort and additional snacks in 1st class. In other trains, there are sometimes only two 1st class 6-berth compartments, which are often quickly booked out. Even with larger 1st class areas, it sometimes happens that these are less comfortable than the 2nd class areas in the same train. For journeys in regional transport, no 1st class is generally offered.
