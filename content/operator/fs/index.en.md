#### Railjet Tarvisio Boscoverde – Venice

ÖBB or FS FIP Coupons are valid in the Italian section on `RJ` trains to Venice. For trips to/from Italy or entirely within Italy, a supplement of 10€ (2nd class) or 15€ (1st class) must be paid.

### Regional trains in Emilia-Romagna

FIP discounts also apply to trains operated by Trenitalia TPER in Emilia-Romagna.

### Strait of Messina Ferry

FIP discounts apply for crossing the Strait of Messina only if the journey is made by train using the train ferry from Villa San Giovanni to Messina.

### Leonardo Express (Rome Fiumicino Airport Shuttle)

### International Frecciarossa trains to Paris

### Treni Touristici (Tourist Trains)

### Buses and Replacement Services

Buses are excluded from FIP discounts, except when replacing a train where FIP would have been recognized (rail replacement services).

### Break of Journey

Break of journey is not permitted on long-distance trains. On regional trains, break of journey is possible without notice or formalities, except for train-bound FIP 50 Tickets with printed train number (see [Train binding in regional trains](#train-binding-in-regional-trains)).

### Train Binding in Regional Trains

On Italian regional trains (`R`/`RV`), tickets may be train-bound. This applies to FIP 50 Tickets, but not to FIP Coupons.

Regional trains are classified as train-bound (_prenotabile_) and not train-bound (_non prenotabile_). Train-bound trains may only be used with tickets issued specifically for that train.

{{% expander "Identifying train-bound tickets" info %}}
**Train-bound:** \
Tickets for train-bound trains are valid only for the train indicated on the ticket. Train-bound trains are identified by:

<img src="/en/operator/fs/prenotabile_2.webp" alt="FS Prenotabile Ticket" style="width: 60%; float: right; margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
The note "prenotabile" in the train information:
<br style="clear:both" />
<img src="/en/operator/fs/prenotabile_1.webp" alt="FS Prenotabile Ticket" style="width: 60%; float: right; margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
Ticket label "Prenotazione - Ordinaria":
<br style="clear:both" />

**Not train-bound:** \
Tickets for not train-bound trains are valid on the booked train and all other not train-bound trains on the route, but not on train-bound trains.

<img src="/en/operator/fs/ordinaria_2.webp" alt="FS Ordinaria Ticket" style="width: 60%; float: right; margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
The note "non prenotabile" in the train information:
<br style="clear:both" />
<img src="/en/operator/fs/ordinaria_1.webp" alt="FS Ordinaria Ticket" style="width: 60%; float: right; margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
Ticket label "Ordinaria":
<br style="clear:both" />

{{% /expander %}}

### Validation of Regional Train Tickets

Tickets for not train-bound regional trains (_non prenotabile_) must be validated at the platform (obliteratrici).

## Recommendations

{{% highlight tip %}}
For long-distance travel, the FIP Coupon is only worthwhile to a limited extent, as the price difference between FIP 50 and Coupon for long-distance trains is minimal. The only exception is `IC` connections, whose reservation is usually much cheaper. On regional trains, the Coupon can be fully used. As 1st class is rarely available on these trains, a 1st class Coupon is usually not worthwhile.
