For all journeys with a FIP Coupon, a free ticket or reservation must be obtained before each journey ([see Train Categories and Reservations](#train-categories-and-reservations)).

FIP Coupons and FIP 50 Tickets are valid on LTG-Link services. For cross-border journeys to/from Poland, either a continuous FIP 50 Ticket or FIP Coupons for both countries are required; for journeys to/from Latvia, only a Lithuanian FIP Coupon or a FIP 50 Ticket is needed, as Latvia is not a FIP member.

FIP 50 Tickets and Coupons from LTG-Link are also valid on LTG-Link trains on the Vilnius – Riga route.[^1]

From Riga to Valga, LTG-Link trains operate on behalf of Vivi (Latvian Railways). FIP discounts are therefore not valid there. When booking, the section should be booked separately so that FIP discounts can be applied to the remaining route (Latvia – Riga).

## Train Categories and Reservations

No distinction is made between different train categories in Lithuania.

{{% highlight important %}}
LTG-Link requires a mandatory free seat reservation on long-distance trains. A list of connections can be found on the [LTG-Link website](https://ltglink.lt/en/passengers-with-interrail-eurail-passes). The prices shown there should be ignored, as they are reduced to zero with a FIP Coupon. With a FIP Coupon, a free ticket (zero-fare ticket) must also be obtained before travel on trains without a reservation requirement.

Trains with mandatory reservations are sometimes fully booked many days in advance. During high season and on holidays between Vilnius and Klaipeda or Riga, trains may be fully booked 2-3 weeks in advance.

Booking opens 30 days before departure for domestic tickets and 60 days before departure for international journeys.

Therefore, before **every** journey with a FIP Coupon, a free ticket (zero-fare ticket) with or without a mandatory reservation or a FIP 50 Ticket must be obtained, which may include a free reservation. (see [Ticket and Reservation Purchase](#ticket-and-reservation-purchase)). [^2]

FIP 1st class discounts apply in all classes. FIP 2nd class discounts apply in 2nd and 3rd class.

1st class passengers receive free drinks and a small snack on some long-distance routes ([More information](https://ltglink.lt/en/benefits-of-first-class)).

Trains have 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class coaches. Except for some seasonal trains between Vilnius and Klaipeda (with all classes), trains usually have either 1st/2nd or 2nd/3rd class combinations.

## Ticket and Reservation Purchase

### Online

{{% booking id="ltg-website" /%}}

### On-Site

Travel centers are now only located in Vilnius, Kaunas, and Klaipeda; whether they will still sell tickets or become information desks only in 2026 was not yet clear at the end of 2025.

The ticket machines now installed at many stations do not issue FIP tickets (as of 11/2025).

## Discounts

With regular tickets, up to 2 children up to and including 7 years old travel free of charge in 2nd class but must sit on their parents' lap. If children up to 7 years want their own seat, 50% of the adult fare must be paid. Children up to 18 years (or as students up to 23 years) receive a 50% discount on the adult fare. Persons aged 18 and over pay the full adult fare, but there are numerous other discounts. An overview is available on the [LTG-Link website](https://ltglink.lt/en/discount-for-children-and-pupils).

## Special Tariff Conditions

### Special Trains and Historic Services

In summer, LTG-Link operates direct trains between Vilnius and the Baltic Sea (“seaside express") on Fridays to Sundays, stopping only in Kretinga and Klaipeda. There is currently no information as to whether FIP is accepted on these trains. In Kretinga there is a bus connection to Palanga, in Klaipeda to the Curonian Spit.

### Break of Journey

A break of journey is not possible, as a separate ticket must be obtained for each journey.

### Bicycle Transport

Bicycles can be taken on all trains. This also applies to bicycles on trains with mandatory reservations. Bicycle transport costs 45% of the regular fare and is linked to the class of your own ticket (2nd or 3rd class). 1st class passengers are not allowed to take bicycles (although it is currently still bookable online, as of 12/2025).

## Recommendations

LTG-Link operates the only lounge in Vilnius. Access is free for 1st class passengers on journeys longer than one hour, and available for other classes for an extra charge. Drinks etc. in the lounge must be paid for at the vending machines.
