Discounted FIP tickets for `RER`, Transilien trains, and trams can be purchased at Transilien ticket counters.

Usually, only a few are issued at a time.

International `TER` trains between France and Geneva in Switzerland are marketed as Léman Express and operated jointly by SNCF and SBB. FIP discounts apply throughout the Léman Express network. SNCF FIP Coupons are also valid on the Swiss section.

### Bus Services

FIP discounts also apply on buses operated by SNCF, except for long-distance buses (e.g. OuiGo Bus). [^1]

## Recommendations

{{% highlight tip %}}
SNCF is not the easiest railway company for FIP, as reservations are often required. It is recommended to plan journeys at least a few days in advance, as trains may be fully booked. However, SNCF is known for fast connections from Paris in all directions, e.g. the 406 km journey between Paris and Strasbourg takes only about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
