<img src="/en/operator/sncf/contramarquedePassage.webp" alt="Contramarque de Passage" style="width: 60%; float: right; margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">

Discounted FIP tickets for `RER`, Transilien trains and trams can be purchased at Transilien ticket counters. When using trains and trams with an SNCF FIP Coupon, a free _Contremarque de Passage_ (temporary access card) must be collected for each journey at the Transilien ticket counter. Usually, only a few are issued at a time.

### Léman Express

International `TER` trains between France and Geneva (Switzerland) are marketed as Léman Express and operated jointly by SNCF and SBB. FIP discounts apply throughout the Léman Express network. SNCF FIP Coupons are also valid in the Swiss section.

### Bus Services

FIP discounts also apply to buses operated by SNCF, except for long-distance bus services (e.g. OuiGo Bus). [^1]

## Recommendations

{{% highlight tip %}}
SNCF is not the easiest railway company for FIP, as reservations are often required. It is recommended to plan journeys at least a few days in advance, as trains may be fully booked. However, SNCF is known for its fast `TGV` connections from Paris in all directions. For example, the 406 km journey between Paris and Strasbourg takes only about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
