## Ticket and Reservation Purchase

Great Britain distinguishes between different ticket categories. FIP 50 Discount is not granted on all tickets.

- **Anytime Tickets:** \
  These tickets are flexible and can be used at any time of day. The price is constant and not quota-based. FIP 50 Discount applies to these tickets. There are Single (one-way) and Return (round-trip) tickets. A Return Ticket is sometimes cheaper than two Single Tickets. Break of journey is possible.
- **Off-Peak Tickets:** \
  These tickets are cheaper than Anytime Tickets but can only be used at restricted times. Usually, the morning peak is excluded, but exact restrictions vary by ticket and are stated in the ticket conditions. FIP 50 Discount applies to these tickets. There are Single (one-way) and Return (round-trip) tickets. A Return Ticket is sometimes cheaper than two Single Tickets. Break of journey is not possible.
- **Advance Tickets:** \
  These tickets are heavily discounted but only valid for the selected train. Tickets can be purchased up to 10 minutes before departure. FIP 50 Discount does not apply to these tickets.
- **Rovers:** \
  Rovers are day or multi-day tickets valid for unlimited travel in a specific area. FIP 50 Discount applies to some Rovers. The [National Rail website](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/ticket-types/promotions/?promotionType=ranger-rover) provides an overview of available Rovers. FIP 50 Discount is only granted on request.

{{% highlight inofficial %}}
[Online](https://www.railforums.co.uk/threads/priv-rovers-and-rangers-2024.270531/) there is an unofficial list of which Rovers are eligible for national staff discounts. It is likely that the FIP Discount is also granted on these Rovers.

As a general guideline: Tickets valid exclusively for National Rail services are typically accepted. Combined rail and bus tickets are generally not valid. For tickets that include National Rail and heritage rail services, validity should be confirmed individually.

For example, the Isle of Wight Ranger covering only SWR services is valid under FIP, whereas the version including steam trains is not (although these are sometimes sold with FIP discount). [^3]
{{% /highlight %}}

- **Season Tickets and London Tickets:** \
  Unlimited travel between two stations for a set period or within specified London zones for a set period. FIP 50 Discount is not available.

On some routes, trains from different operators run. Different Anytime and Off-Peak Tickets are sold for these routes. These tickets are only valid on the respective operator's trains or on all operators on the route (_Any Route_). [BR Fares](https://www.brfares.com/) provides an overview of available tickets per route. Advance Tickets are always tied to a specific train.

{{% highlight tip %}}
Through the [_Seatfrog_](https://seatfrog.com/) app, upgrades to First Class can be purchased for FIP 50 Tickets and FIP Coupons in Second Class. [^5]

## Recommendations

There are two major railway museums in Great Britain. The main site is next to York station. A second site is next to Shildon station and is called Locomotion. Both museums are free and offer a good insight into the history of railways in Great Britain. More information on the [Railway Museum in York](https://railwaymuseum.org.uk) and [Locomotion in Shildon](https://locomotion.org.uk).

{{% highlight tip %}}
Long-distance trains in Great Britain often offer particularly good service in First Class, including snacks, meals, and (alcoholic) drinks. Notably, Avanti on the West Coast Main Line and LNER on the East Coast Main Line. Larger stations often have lounges accessible with a FIP Coupon or FIP 50 Ticket for First Class. These also offer snacks, meals, and (alcoholic) drinks depending on the operator. A First Class FIP Coupon is especially worthwhile in Great Britain.
{{% /highlight %}}

Great Britain can also be explored by night trains:

- The Caledonian Sleeper connects London with several destinations in Scotland. Travelers can choose between seats, couchettes, and sleeping compartments. Reservation is required and can be made online.
- The Night Riviera Sleeper connects London with Penzance in southwest England. There are various compartment options with mandatory reservation. Unfortunately, online reservation is not possible.
