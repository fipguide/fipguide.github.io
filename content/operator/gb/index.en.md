{{% highlight tip %}}
Long-distance trains in Great Britain often offer particularly good service in First Class, including snacks, meals, and (alcoholic) drinks. Notably, Avanti on the West Coast Main Line and LNER on the East Coast Main Line. Larger stations often have lounges accessible with a FIP Coupon or FIP 50 Ticket for First Class. These also offer snacks, meals, and (alcoholic) drinks depending on the operator. A First Class FIP Coupon is especially worthwhile in Great Britain.
