## Recommendations

There are two major railway museums in Great Britain. The main site is next to York station. A second site is next to Shildon station and is called Locomotion. Both museums are free and offer a good insight into the history of railways in Great Britain. More information on the [Railway Museum in York](https://railwaymuseum.org.uk) and [Locomotion in Shildon](https://locomotion.org.uk).

{{% highlight tip %}}
Long-distance trains in Great Britain often offer particularly good service in First Class, including snacks, meals, and (alcoholic) drinks. Notably, Avanti on the West Coast Main Line and LNER on the East Coast Main Line. Larger stations often have lounges accessible with a FIP Coupon or FIP 50 Ticket for First Class. These also offer snacks, meals, and (alcoholic) drinks depending on the operator. A First Class FIP Coupon is especially worthwhile in Great Britain.
