## Recommendations

{{% highlight tip %}}
BDŽ still offers a relatively wide range of services on an aging rail network. It is worth planning your routes in advance, as many lines have only a few trains per day. The most modern coaches are former DB IC cars, used on some long-distance routes between Sofia and Varna or Burgas. A special highlight is the narrow-gauge Rhodope railway between Septemvri and Dobrinishte, also operated by BDŽ.
