## Ticket and reservation purchase

### Online

- It is not possible to book reservations, FIP global price or FIP 50 online.

### By telephone

- It is possible to book by telephone with Renfe, but the ticket must be collected from a Spanish counter within a few days.

### On-site

- DB Travel Center:
  Tickets for trains requiring reservations can be sold at DB Travel Centers. Please ensure that either "T" (for Turista) or "P" (for Preferente) is specified as the class. If 1st class or 2nd class is selected as the class, tickets will not be issued with an error message.
  It has also been reported that the booking of class "P" sometimes fails, in which case a booking of class "T" often works. There is no booking fee. \

## Arrival and Border Points

### France
From Paris, direct TGV trains operated by the French SNCF run to Barcelona. Renfe also operates cross-border services between Lyon and Barcelona. FIP global fares are available with both operators, although they can be very expensive. Overall, there are very few cross-border connections, and the network was significantly better developed just a few years ago.

### Portugal
Connections between Spain and Portugal are currently very limited. For example, to travel from Lisbon to Madrid, one must change trains and take a long regional journey to the Spanish border at Badajoz, where one of the few trains to Madrid can be caught. This requires FIP tickets or free passes from Portuguese rail operator CP, as well as a Renfe ticket for the Spanish section. Additionally, there is the Celta connection from Porto to Vigo, although this does not extend further into Spain. A FIP global fare is valid for the entire route. A continuous high-speed rail line between Lisbon and Madrid is currently under development.

### Border Points

{{% expander "Border points" %}}
| Railway operator | Border Points |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CP | Ayamonte, Badajoz (fr), Barca de Alva (fr), Fuentes de Onoro (fr), Valença (fr), Valencia de Alcántara (fr) |
| SNCF | Canfranc (fr), Hendaye (fr), Port-Bou (fr), La Tour-de-Carol-Enveitg |

## Special Tariff Conditions

### Interruption of Travel

With FIP 50 and FIP Global Price tickets, the journey may not be interrupted along the way.[^2]

## Experiences

{{% highlight tip %}}
Renfe can often be compared more to an airline than to other railway companies. Luggage checks are common on long-distance routes, and there are few trains that allow spontaneous boarding. Therefore, an FIP free travel pass is only marginally worthwhile, as it can be used in only a few cases. Due to ticket barriers at many stations, staff must be contacted each time in order to open them with the free travel pass. Personal experience shows that especially in the greater Madrid area, the free travel option is sometimes not recognized, and access is consequently denied.
