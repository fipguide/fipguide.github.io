## Ticket and reservation purchase

### Online

### By telephone

- It is possible to book by telephone with Renfe, but the ticket must be collected from a Spanish counter within a few days.

### On-site

- DB Travel Center:
  Tickets for trains requiring reservations can be sold at DB Travel Centers. Please ensure that either "T" (for Elige Estándar / Turista) or "P" (for Elige Confort) is specified as the class. If 1st class or 2nd class is selected as the class, tickets will not be issued with an error message. A booking of Premium class tickets is not possible through Deutsche Bahn's sales channels.
  It has also been reported that the booking of class "P" sometimes fails, in which case a booking of class "T" often works. There is no booking fee. \

### Interruption of Travel

With FIP 50 and FIP Global Fare tickets, the journey may not be interrupted along the way.[^2]

## Recommendations

{{% highlight tip %}}
Renfe can often be compared more to an airline than to other railway companies. Luggage checks are common on long-distance routes, and there are few trains that allow spontaneous boarding. Therefore, an FIP Coupon is only marginally worthwhile, as it can be used in only a few cases. Due to ticket barriers at many stations, staff must be contacted each time in order to open them with the free travel pass. Personal experience shows that especially in the greater Madrid area, the free travel option is sometimes not recognized, and access is consequently denied.
