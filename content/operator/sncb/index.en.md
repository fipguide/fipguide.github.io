### On the train

If no ticket counter is available or open, a ticket can be purchased on board the train from the conductor if approached immediately. The usual SNCB surcharge for on-board sales is not charged in this case. [^2]

## Discounts

Children up to 5 years old travel free on SNCB trains. Children aged 6 to 11 are entitled to a 50% discount on the adult fare, and from 12 years old, they pay the adult fare. If they are FIP eligible, they also pay only half the normal price with FIP 50. [^1]

## Special Tariff Conditions

### Brussels Zaventem Airport

For connections to and from Brussels Zaventem Airport, a surcharge must be paid for the FIP Coupon. This currently amounts to 6.70€ (see [SNCB info](https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/tickets-and-railcards/airports/brussels-airport)) and must also be paid if the note _No Supplement Necessary_ is indicated. For FIP 50 tickets, this is already included in the price. [^1]

## Recommendations

{{% highlight tip %}}
The first class in SNCB / NMBS trains is often used with second class tickets. Also, the 1st class is usually not much more comfortable than the second class. Unlike in other countries, buying first class tickets to have more space and quiet is only worthwhile to a limited extent.
