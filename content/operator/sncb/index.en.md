## Arrival and Border Points

### Luxembourg

From Luxembourg, cross-border SNCB trains to LiÃ¨ge or Brussels can be used. In 2nd class, the FIP ticket (Coupon or FIP 50) is sufficient for the entire route, as public transport in Luxembourg is free in 2nd class. For 1st class, an additional FIP ticket for CFL is required.

### Germany

From Germany, the cross-border ICE from Frankfurt / Cologne / Aachen can be used to enter the SNCB network. A regional train of SNCB also runs between Aachen and LiÃ¨ge. In both cases, an additional ticket for the German section of DB is required. The Eurostar (formerly Thalys) can also be used from Germany to reach the SNCB network. Here, a special FIP ticket from Eurostar is required for the entire section (including within Belgium) .([see Eurostar]({{% ref "/operator/eurostar" %}} "Eurostar"))

### Netherlands

From the Netherlands, cross-border regional trains (including IC here) can be used, requiring an additional FIP ticket for NS. The Eurostar (formerly Thalys) can also be used from the Netherlands to reach the SNCB network. Here, a special FIP ticket from Eurostar is required for the entire section (including within Belgium) .([see Eurostar]({{% ref "/operator/eurostar" %}} "Eurostar"))

### France

From France, cross-border regional trains can be used, requiring an additional FIP ticket for the French section. For international TGV trains, there is a global price, and FIP free travel passes are not valid as they are not operated by SNCB. The Eurostar (formerly Thalys) can also be used from France to reach the SNCB network. Here, a special FIP ticket from Eurostar is required for the entire section (including within Belgium) .([see Eurostar]({{% ref "/operator/eurostar" %}} "Eurostar"))

## Discounts

Children up to 5 years old travel free on SNCB trains. Children aged 6 to 11 are entitled to a 50% discount on the adult fare, and from 12 years old, they pay the adult fare. If they are FIP eligible, they also pay only half the normal price with FIP 50. [^1]

## Special Tariff Conditions

### Brussels Zaventem Airport

For connections to and from Brussels Zaventem Airport, a surcharge must be paid for the FIP Coupon. This currently amounts to 6.70 euros (see [SNCB info](https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/tickets-and-railcards/airports/brussels-airport)) and must also be paid if the note *No Supplement Necessary* is indicated. For FIP 50 tickets, this is already included in the price. [^1]

## Experiences

{{% highlight inofficial %}}
The first class in SNCB / NMBS trains is often used with second class tickets. Also, the 1st class is usually not much more comfortable than the second class. Unlike in other countries, buying first class tickets to have more space and quiet is only worthwhile to a limited extent.
