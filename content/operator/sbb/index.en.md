## Special Tariff Conditions

### Buses and Rail Replacement Services

FIP tickets are not valid on SBB-operated bus lines unless they are rail replacement services.

### Mutual Recognition of SBB and BLS Coupons

The Swiss railway companies SBB and BLS have an agreement for mutual recognition of FIP Coupons. International FIP Coupons of SBB are fully accepted on the entire BLS rail network. [^2]

However, SBB Coupons are not valid on BLS ships on Lake Thun and Lake Brienz, nor on BLS buses, which mainly operate in the Emmental region. [^2]

### Cross-border Trains (Italy, France)

For cross-border `EC` trains to Italy and `TGV` trains to France, a surcharge is required outside Switzerland. \
This surcharge (including reservation) is mandatory, even with an FIP Free Pass or FIP 50 Ticket.
- 2nd class: €11
- 1st class: €13

The surcharge can be purchased at ticket counters (in Switzerland, France, or Italy). On EC trains to Italy, it is also possible to buy the surcharge on board.

## Recommendations

{{% highlight tip %}}
The FIP Coupon is especially worthwhile for SBB CFF FFS, as you can travel a dense rail network with few special conditions. Since reservations are uncommon on national connections in Switzerland, traveling is very relaxed. 1st class is also highly recommended, as the comfort is noticeably higher, especially in Giruno trains.
