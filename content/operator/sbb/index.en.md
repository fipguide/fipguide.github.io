### On the Train

FIP Tickets cannot be purchased on the train. A penalty fee is charged for passengers without tickets.

## Discounts

Children travel free on regular journeys (not special trips) up to and including 6 years of age. Children up to and including 15 years receive a 50% discount on the adult fare. From the age of 16, the regular adult fare applies.

## Special Fare Conditions

### Buses and Rail Replacement Services

FIP tickets are not valid on SBB-operated bus lines unless they are rail replacement services.

### Mutual Recognition of SBB and BLS Coupons

The Swiss railway companies SBB and BLS have an agreement for mutual recognition of FIP Coupons.
International FIP Coupons of SBB are fully accepted on the entire BLS rail network. [^2]

However, SBB Coupons are not valid on BLS ships on Lake Thun and Lake Brienz, nor on BLS buses, which mainly operate in the Emmental region. [^2]

### Cross-border Trains (Italy, France)

Cross-border EC trains between Switzerland and Italy as well as TGV trains to and from France require a surcharge outside Switzerland. A special global fare applies, and the FIP Coupon or FIP 50 Ticket alone is not sufficient. Within Switzerland, these trains can be used without special surcharges/reservations. These are among the few trains in Switzerland that require some form of reservation (but only for the section outside Switzerland). The reservation with surcharge is best obtained at a travel center on site (in Switzerland, Italy, France).

## Recommendations

{{% highlight tip %}}
The FIP Coupon is especially worthwhile for SBB CFF FFS, as you can travel a dense rail network with few special conditions. Since reservations are uncommon on national connections in Switzerland, traveling is very relaxed. 1st class is also highly recommended, as the comfort is noticeably higher, especially in Giruno trains.
