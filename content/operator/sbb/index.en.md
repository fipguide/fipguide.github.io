### Buses and Rail Replacement Services

FIP Tickets are not valid on SBB-operated bus lines unless they are rail replacement services.

### Mutual Recognition of SBB and BLS Coupons

The Swiss rail companies SBB and BLS partially accept each other's FIP Coupons: [^2]

- SBB FIP Coupons are accepted on all BLS trains.
- BLS FIP Coupons are accepted on SBB trains on routes where BLS trains also operate, i.e. between two stations served by both SBB and BLS. The BLS network map is available online: https://www.bls.ch/-/media/bls/pdf/fahrplaene/bahn/netzplaene/netzplan-bls-bahn.pdf

- SBB FIP Coupons are not valid on BLS ships on Lake Thun and Lake Brienz, nor on BLS buses, which mainly operate in the Emmental.

### Cross-border Trains (Italy, France)

For cross-border `EC` trains to Italy and `TGV` trains to France, a surcharge is required outside Switzerland in addition to the FIP Coupon. The surcharge can be purchased at ticket counters (in Switzerland, France, or Italy). On EC trains to Italy, it can also be purchased on board or at a reduced price via Deutsche Bahn. [See Travel to Italy]({{< ref "/country/switzerland#italy" >}} "Travel to Italy")

## Recommendations

{{% highlight tip %}}
The FIP Coupon is especially worthwhile for SBB CFF FFS, as you can travel a dense rail network with few special conditions. Since reservations are uncommon on national connections in Switzerland, traveling is very relaxed. 1st class is also highly recommended, as the comfort is noticeably higher, especially in Giruno trains.
