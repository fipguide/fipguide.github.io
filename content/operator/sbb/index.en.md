## Ticket and reservation purchase

### Online

- [ZSSK website](https://www.zssk.sk): \
  **Reservation:** ‚úÖ \
  In the connection search, you can select "I have the ticket already I want to purchase only reservation or additional service" on the English website. Then choose "Reservation" and select "International ticket/Rail Pass" as the discount in the passenger selection, ensuring "Entitled for 100% discount" is selected. \
  **FIP 50 tickets:** ‚úÖ \
  Select "FIP Ticket 50%" as the discount during the purchase process.
- Other options: \
  Reservations are also possible through the websites of [CD](https://www.cd.cz), [DB](https://www.bahn.de), and [√ñBB](https://www.oebb.at) at sometimes different prices. IC and SC trains are excluded.

### On-site

- ZSR ticket counters: \
  In Slovakia, there is an extensive network of ticket counters even at smaller stations. It is advantageous to speak some Slovak or Czech or have the appropriate translator app, as English (or German) is often not widely spoken. \
  **Reservation:** ‚úÖ \
  **FIP 50 tickets:** ‚úÖ
- Other options: \
  FIP 50 tickets and reservations can also be purchased at CD, DB, and √ñBB travel centers.

### On the train

If no ticket counter is available or open, a ticket (or reservation in Ex) can be purchased on board the train from the conductor if approached immediately.[^1]

## Arrival and border points

### Czech Republic

From the Czech Republic, cross-border trains of Ceske Drahy or ZSSK can be used on various routes. An additional FIP 50 ticket or FIP Coupon of Ceske Drahy is required. Cross-border trains of RegioJet cannot be used with FIP.

### Austria

From Austria, cross-border InterCitys, RailJets, and regional trains (REX) are offered. For all connections, an additional FIP Coupon of the Austrian Federal Railways (√ñBB) is required. FIP 50 tickets must be purchased cross-border.

### Hungary

From Hungary, both cross-border regional trains and EuroCity trains can be used. On the connection from Bratislava south via the Rajka border crossing to Hegyeshalom, an additional FIP ticket of GySEV is required; in other cases, an additional FIP ticket of MAV-Start is required.

### Poland

The only regularly served cross-border route currently is the route from Slovak Skalite to Polish Zwardon. It is operated in cooperation by ZSSK and Koleje ≈ölƒÖskie. ZSSK free travel passes are only valid up to the border point. Theoretically, it should be possible to travel cross-border for free with an additional free travel pass of Koleje ≈ölƒÖskie, but this should be confirmed in advance. Cross-border FIP 50 tickets cannot be purchased through the ZSSK website, but may be possible at a ZSSK ticket counter.

### Ukraine

From Ko≈°ice, cross-border regional trains run to Chop and Mukacheve. Since FIP is not valid in Ukraine, a regular ticket is required at least from the border point. A cross-border ticket can only be purchased without FIP discount on the ZSSK website. If the train has an intermediate stop in Cierna nad Tisou, it is possible to buy a regular ticket from this station via the website. For a cheaper ticket, it is best to ask at a ZSSK ticket counter if there are better options.

## Discounts

Children up to 6 years travel free on ZSSK trains when accompanied by a person aged at least 16 years. In 1st class, this is limited to 2 children; from the 3rd child, 50% of the ticket price is due. In EC trains, an additional 1 ‚Ç¨ per child is charged in 1st class from the 3rd child. In SC trains, 1 ‚Ç¨ per child is always charged in 2nd class and 3 ‚Ç¨ in 1st class. In IC trains, a reservation including a surcharge for the train category must be purchased for each child.[^1]

Children between 6 and 16 years, regardless of nationality, have the opportunity to get free travel with ZSSK. However, this involves some effort. The following is required:

- Photo (2x3cm) of the child
- ID of the child (if no ID is available, the combination of the child's birth certificate and the ID of the guardian is also possible)

This must be presented by the guardian at a ticket counter. Depending on the system available at the counter, registration can either be done immediately or take up to 3 working days. In the end, you get a confirmation that must always be carried on the trains. Additionally, a ticket is still required, which can be booked for 0 euros on the [ZSSK website](https://www.zssk.sk/) by selecting the appropriate travel group (Important: "Entitled for 100% discount" must be selected). For EC trains, an additional reservation fee of 1 ‚Ç¨ is added, for SC trains 5 ‚Ç¨. IC trains and RJ trains cannot be used.[^1]
Without all the effort, children between 6 and 16 years can travel with a 50% discount. This also allows the use of IC trains with a 1 ‚Ç¨ fee, in SC trains 1 ‚Ç¨ in 2nd class and 3 ‚Ç¨ in 1st class. An official document with a photo, age, date of birth, and (if possible) birth number must be carried.[^1] \
For children over 16 years, there is no discount, but it is possible for students under 26 years and pensioners from 62 years from the EU (as well as students from all over the world studying in Slovakia) to also get free travel, similar to children between 6 and 16 years. Since this is not directly related to FIP, we refer to the page [ZSSK Zero Fare](https://www.zssk.sk/en/zero-fare/).

## Special Tariff Conditions

A break in the journey is only possible for distances of 101 km and more.

Buses are excluded from FIP discounts, except when they replace a train where FIP would have been recognized (rail replacement service).[^1]
