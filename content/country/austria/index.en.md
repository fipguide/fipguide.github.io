## FIP usage

Austria is easily accessible by train with both FIP 50 and FIP free travel vouchers (coupons). FIP ÖBB includes only ÖBB trains + IC Bus services between Graz and Klagenfurt (until December 2025); the subsidiary ÖBB Postbus is not included (except for SEV).
Of particular note is the surcharge for long-distance travel with the FIP coupon (€10 in 2nd class and €15 in 1st class; this can be purchased on the train without a surcharge and is valid for 2 days, similar to the FIP coupon). Business class on the ÖBB Railjet is also not available with the FIP coupon (even with the associated surcharge). Children under 6 travel free of charge; from the age of 6, a surcharge (€10/€15) is also payable for each child traveling with the FIP coupon on long-distance travel. A quick tip for those with children: the ÖBB Vorteilscard Family (€19) [oebb.at](https://www.oebb.at/de/tickets-kundenkarten/kundenkarten/vorteilscard)

Westbahn and RegioJet also operate parallel to ÖBB; these cannot be used with FIP tickets. These are abbreviated to 'IC' or 'WB' (not to be confused with the ÖBB's 'IC') in the connection information. In case of doubt, the carrier can be clarified via the respective provider's website or via [Bahn.de](https://www.bahn.de).

GySEV/Raaberbahn is a second railway company offering FIP within Austria and Hungary. The following lines can be used with FIP GySEV in Austria:
REX63 Neusiedl am See-Fertőszentmiklós
REX6 Vienna Hbf to Sopron via Deutschkreuz
REX65 Eisenstadt - Wulkapordersdorf (connection with REX6 and through connection to Vienna Hbf)
(Only GySEV journeys in Austria are listed here; further GySEV routes in Hungary can be found at Gysev)

## (FIP) Ticket Booking in Austria
FIP 50% tickets can be issued at all ÖBB ticket machines and ticket counters. At the ticket machine, search for "at. Fbg / FIP Inland" under the discounts (at the very bottom). From Germany, you can also book tickets and Nightjet reservations via the service hotline 00435. 1717 to order (credit card and email required). FIP tickets cannot be booked in the ÖBB app or online at the ÖBB Ticketshop! Tip: Tickets are cheaper in advance (1 day before the trip or 15 days before the trip).
FIP 50% tickets for GySEV journeys are also available at ÖBB ticket machines.

For arrival and departure, you can of course also use the DB FIP online offer with FIP 50: [Bahn.de](https://www.bahn.de/buchung/start?KL=2&ET=FIP_DB)

## Useful information

Austria has a dense rail network, which primarily consists of two main routes. The Southern Railway from Vienna via Graz towards Slovenia and Klagenfurt/Villach onwards to Italy (from December via the "Koralmbahn" high-speed line, currently still via the old line), and the Western Railway from Vienna via Salzburg/Innsbruck to Lake Constance (Bregenz) and further to Switzerland (Zurich). Both routes are and will continue to be well developed, with trains running between From the larger train stations, there are often half-hourly departures. There are also numerous beautiful main and branch lines, such as the breathtaking Tauern Railway (Salzburg-Villach), the Ennstal Railway (Salzburg-Bischofshofen-Schladming-Leoben), and the Brenner Railway (Munich-Innsbruck-Brenner-Bolzano-Verona).
A special highlight is the ride on the Schneeberg Railway in Lower Austria. This is not operated by the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB), but can be used with a 50% discount on tickets with a FIP pass. All other (private) branch lines do not accept FIPs (e.g., GKB, NÖVOG, Styrian, Zillertal, Pinzgau, Montafon, Achensee, and Salzburg Local Railways).

Fun fact: The railway through Lichtenstein is operated by the ÖBB, so you can travel here with an FIP pass at no extra cost (Feldkirchen-Buchs SG).

### Czech Republic

From the Czech Republic, cross-border Ceske Drahy trains can be used on various routes. A FIP 50 ticket or FIP free pass from Ceske Drahy is also required. Cross-border RegioJet trains cannot be used with FIP.

### Germany

Note the restricted list ;-)
ÖBB Nightjets from Germany to Austria (but also Switzerland/Italy/France/Netherlands) cannot be used with DB travel concessions (Tages M Fern/NetzCard) within Germany. However, an FIP global price offer can be booked via the ÖBB service hotline or DB travel center.

### Hungary

From Hungary, both cross-border regional trains and Eurocity trains/railjet can be used. An additional FIP ticket from MAV is required for the connection from Vienna to Budapest via the Hegyeshalom border crossing; in other cases, an additional FIP ticket from GySEV is required.

### Switzerland

From Austria, you can reach Buchs SG and St. Margreten (ECE, Railjet, and local transport) with an FIP ÖBB ticket and coupon. A special feature to note when entering from Germany is that on the Lindau-St. Margreten section, Austria must be paid as a transit country. In theory, when traveling with an FIP coupon, you also have to pay the surcharge (€10/€15). It's better to book FIP 50 for this.

### Italy

A rather FIP-unfriendly but beautiful country, it starts at the border. The FIP coupon (FS or ÖBB) is only valid on ÖBB/DB Brenner trains with a surcharge (€10 2nd class / €15 1st class). The same applies to journeys from Tarvisio B. to Venice. A special feature when traveling via Austria/Slovenia to Trieste on the EC 151/134 is that the ÖBB FIP Coupon is valid on the Italian section (V. Opicina-Trieste); you only have to pay a small surcharge (€2.60).

### Slovakia

Slovakia is easily accessible by train with both FIP 50 and FIP free tickets. FIP includes the company ŽSR (Železnice Slovenskej republiky, in German: Railways of Slovakia). Coming from Vienna, it's worth taking a trip to the capital, Bratislava, just 45 minutes away.

### Slovenia

From Vienna/Graz to Ljubljana/Maribor via Spielfeld-Strass (Gr), there are long-distance and local services, as well as direct connections to Trieste and Zagreb. Simply book an FIP Coupon SZ or FIP 50% ticket.

## FIP Rating

Overall, Austria has an impeccable infrastructure and scenic routes, and most journeys are operated by ÖBB (Austrian Federal Railways). This makes it possible to travel across a large part of the country with FIP tickets. Unlike ours, the railway system is very reliable. However, the FIP experience is somewhat marred by the surcharge (without reservation) for long-distance travel, regardless of the route (€15 in 1st class, €10 in 2nd class), as well as the fact that DB discounted fares on the Nightjet (within Germany) are not recognized.
