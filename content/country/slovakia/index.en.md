## FIP Information

Slovakia can be easily traveled by train with both FIP 50 and FIP Coupons. Included in FIP is the operator ŽSR (Železnice Slovenskej republiky, translated as Railways of the Slovak Republic). The trains themselves are operated by [ZSSK]({{< ref "/operator/zsr" >}} "ZSR/ZSSK") (Železničná
spoločnosť Slovensko), for which the FIP tickets of ŽSR are valid.
Particular attention should be paid to reservation conditions on long-distance trains as well as extended regulations for the free transport of children.

Also operating in Slovakia are the operators LeoExpress and RegioJet, which cannot be used with FIP tickets. These are abbreviated in the connection information with `LE` and `RJ` (not to be confused with `RJ` for RailJet). In case of doubt, the operator can be clarified via the respective provider's website or via [Bahn.de](https://www.bahn.de).

## Interesting

Slovakia has a dense rail network, which mainly consists of two main routes. One coming from Vienna through the capital Bratislava via Poprad Tatry to the second largest city Košice, and one coming from the Czech Republic from Bratislava via Nové Zámky to the Hungarian capital Budapest. Both routes are well developed and continue to be improved, with trains running between the larger stations often hourly. In addition, there are many beautiful branch lines, some of which are served very sporadically. A special highlight is the ride in the High Tatras with the Tatranská železnica, which belongs to ZSSK and can also be traveled with FIP. This makes it possible to travel up mountain ranges and reach the cable cars to the very high mountains.

### Czech Republic

From the Czech Republic, cross-border trains of Ceske Drahy or ZSSK can be used on various routes. An additional FIP 50 ticket or FIP Coupon of Ceske Drahy is required. Cross-border trains of RegioJet cannot be used with FIP.

### Austria

From Austria, cross-border InterCitys, RailJets, and regional trains (REX) are offered. For all connections, an additional FIP Coupon of the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) is required. FIP 50 tickets must be purchased cross-border.

### Hungary

From Hungary, both cross-border regional trains and EuroCity trains can be used. On the connection from Bratislava south via the Rajka border crossing to Hegyeshalom, an additional FIP ticket of GySEV is required; in other cases, an additional FIP ticket of MAV-Start is required.

### Poland

The only regularly served cross-border route currently is the route from Slovak Skalite to Polish Zwardon. It is operated in cooperation by ZSSK and Koleje Śląskie. ZSSK free travel passes are only valid up to the border point. Theoretically, it should be possible to travel cross-border for free with an additional free travel pass of Koleje Śląskie, but this should be confirmed in advance. Cross-border FIP 50 tickets cannot be purchased through the ZSSK website, but may be possible at a ZSSK ticket counter.

### Ukraine

From Košice, cross-border regional trains run to Chop and Mukacheve. Since FIP is not valid in Ukraine, a regular ticket is required at least from the border point. A cross-border ticket can only be purchased without FIP discount on the ZSSK website. If the train has an intermediate stop in Cierna nad Tisou, it is possible to buy a regular ticket from this station via the website. For a cheaper ticket, it is best to ask at a ZSSK ticket counter if there are better options.

## FIP Rating

Overall, Slovakia has a good infrastructure and most journeys are operated by ZSSK. This makes it possible to travel a large part of the country with FIP tickets. However, the FIP experience is somewhat marred by reservation requirements (always in 1st class, in 2nd class on Intercity trains) as well as rather poor information systems and often not good scheduling on the branch lines.

## Operators without FIP

- RegioJet
