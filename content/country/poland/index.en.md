## FIP Information

Poland is the country with the most different railway companies that offer FIP. It depends very much on which voivodeships (parts of Poland) the journeys should go through. The most important operator is the state railway company [PKP](/operator/pkp "PKP") (Polskie Koleje Państwowe), which with its subsidiaries covers almost the complete long-distance traffic as well as large parts of regional traffic. In addition to PKP Intercity and Polregio, PKP also includes the local rail system of Gdansk (Tri-City) and the regional traffic of Koleje Mazowieckie (KM).

The following regionally operating railway companies offer FIP separately:

- [Koleje Dolnośląskie (KD)](/operator/kd)
- [Koleje Śląskie (KŚ)](/operator/ks)
- [Koleje Wielkopolskie (KW)](/operator/kw)
- [Łódzka Kolej Aglomeracyjna (ŁKA)](/operator/lka)

The local rail system in Warsaw (Szybka Kolej Miejska w Warszawie) cannot be used with FIP Tickets. It is abbreviated as SKM, just like the one in Gdansk. FIP is also not accepted on trains of the Koleje Małopolskie (KML). The Stowarzyszenie Kolejowych Przewozów Lokalnych (SKPL) cannot be used with FIP, unless it operates on behalf of railway companies that accept FIP.

Apart from this, FIP coverage in Poland is very high. In long-distance traffic, reservations are sometimes necessary at PKP InterCity and also generally recommended, as the trains are often very well utilized. In regional traffic, generally only 2nd class is offered.

## Interesting

The country has one of the larger rail networks in Europe with about 19,000 km. Especially the main routes between the most important cities have been expanded in recent years for more capacity and higher speeds. The top performer is the Gdansk - Warsaw - Katowice axis with up to 200 km/h. In contrast, there are some routes (especially in regional traffic) that can only be traveled at 60 km/h. In the future, however, high-speed lines with higher speeds across Poland are also planned.

The condition, density and frequency of railway lines are often very dependent on the region. In Lower Silesia (Dolnośląskie), for example, some routes have been reactivated and made more efficient in recent years. In general, however, it can be said that the frequencies are usually in need of improvement. On many routes, only individual trains per day are offered.

### Belarus

Currently no trains operate between Belarus and Poland.

### Germany

From Germany, the Polish network can be reached via several routes. The most used border crossing is in Frankfurt (Oder). Eurocity trains between Berlin and Warsaw run every 2 hours during the day via this crossing. In addition, individual services between Berlin and Gdynia / Krakow / Przemysl can also be found in the timetable.

In addition to the long-distance trains, there are also individual regional trains between Frankfurt (Oder) and Rzepin / Zielona Góra, which like the `EC` trains can be used with PKP FIP Tickets plus ticket for the DB section.

Exclusively in long-distance traffic, the Horka border crossing has also been used since December 2025 for direct trains between Leipzig and Wrocław, Krakow to Przemyśl. These `EC` trains can also be used with PKP FIP Tickets plus ticket for the DB section.

The other border crossings are currently only served by regional traffic. For trains via Forst, Grambow, Guben and Tantow, the same rule applies as for the border crossings mentioned above, so FIP Tickets from PKP plus ticket for the DB section must be available. At Kostrzyn, the operator on the German side is Niederbarnimer Eisenbahn (NEB), for which no FIP Tickets are valid, for the Polish section PKP FIP Tickets should be valid.

A special feature is the Zgorzelec border crossing, here no ticket is required for the section between German Görlitz and Zgorzelec station.

### Lithuania

There are very few cross-border trains between Poland and Lithuania. One train pair runs from Krakow via Warsaw to Vilnius. At the border station Mockava, a change of trains is required, but the journey is sold as a through connection. The transfer is either on the same platform or via a level crossing to the neighboring platform. In Mockava, connecting trains will wait for delayed arrivals. Tickets and reservations can be purchased online ([see Ticket Purchase](/operator/ltg#online)). For cross-border journeys to or from Poland, either a continuous FIP 50 Ticket or FIP Coupons for both countries are required.

The number of tickets is limited, as travel is only possible with a seat reservation. Since December 2025, a fixed seat reservation is assigned only in the PKP `IC` train, while on the LTG-Link railcar there is free choice of seats.

### Slovakia

The only cross-border route currently served regularly is the route from Slovak Skalite to Polish Zwardoń. It is operated in cooperation by ZSSK with Koleje Śląskie. The FIP Coupons of Slovak ZSSK are valid up to the border point.

Theoretically, it should be possible to travel cross-border free of charge with an additional FIP Coupon from Koleje Śląskie, but this should be inquired about beforehand. Cross-border FIP 50 Tickets cannot be purchased via the KŚ or ZSSK website, but this may be possible at a KŚ or ZSSK ticket office.

Other cross-border routes, which are only served seasonally, are the routes Poprad-Tatry - Plaveč - Muszyna (only served on weekends) and Medzilaborce - Łupków - Rzeszów (only served on weekends during the high season July/August). On both routes, FIP discounts from ZSSK are recognized in the Slovak section, while in the Polish section the first-mentioned route requires an FIP Ticket from KM, and the latter one from PKP.

### Czechia

Between Czechia and Poland, regular trains are offered in both long-distance and regional traffic. Via Bohumin and Zebrzydowice, Eurocity trains run between Ostrava (sometimes coming from Vienna) to Katowice and Warsaw or to Krakow. These can be used with FIP Tickets from PKP and ČD plus reservation. Regional trains via these two border crossings are operated partly by PKP and partly by KŚ. Via Cesky Tesin, regional trains run to Polish Cieszyn, which are operated on the Czech side by ČD; who operates these in Poland is currently unknown to us.

The same applies to regional trains between Mikulovice and Krnov, which make a short detour to Poland and stop in Głuchołazy. Easier is the Harrachov border crossing, via which regional trains run between Szklarska Poreba and Liberec. These trains are operated on the Polish side by KD and on the Czech side by ČD.

Via Lichkov, EC trains run between Wrocław (sometimes coming from Gdynia) and Prague, for which tickets from PKP and ČD plus reservation are required. Regional trains are operated on the Polish side by KD. In Czechia, services are operated by Leo Express, therefore FIP is not valid on this section.

Further cross-border regional train connections can only be used with FIP on the Polish side.

### Ukraine

Coming from Ukraine, you can travel to Poland either via the route Kyiv - Chełm or via Kyiv - Lviv - Przemyśl. Long-distance trains run on both routes, operated by Ukrzaliznytsia in the Ukrainian section and PKP Intercity on the Polish section. Continuous FIP Tickets are not possible, as Ukrzaliznytsia is not a FIP member. So at most you can try to get a discount for the Polish partial section, but since this is very small, it is probably more sensible to simply buy a ticket at normal price.

### Russia

Currently no trains operate between Russia and Poland.
