## FIP Information

Poland is the country with the most different railway companies that offer FIP. It depends very much on which voivodeships (parts of Poland) the journeys should go through. The most important operator is the state railway company [PKP]({{< ref "/operator/pkp" >}} "PKP") (Polskie Koleje Państwowe), which with its subsidiaries covers almost the complete long-distance traffic as well as large parts of regional traffic. In addition to PKP Intercity and Polregio, PKP also includes the local rail system of Gdansk (Tri-City) and the regional traffic of Koleje Mazowieckie (KM). The following regionally operating railway companies offer FIP separately:
- Koleje Dolnośląskie (KD)
- Koleje Śląskie (KS)
- Koleje Wielkopolskie (KW)
- Łódzka Kolej Aglomeracyjna (ŁKA)

The local rail system in Warsaw (Szybka Kolej Miejska w Warszawie) cannot be used with FIP tickets. It is abbreviated as SKM, just like the one in Gdansk. Apart from this, FIP coverage in Poland is very high. In long-distance traffic, reservations are sometimes necessary at PKP InterCity and also generally recommended, as the trains are often very well utilized. In regional traffic, generally only 2nd class is offered.

## Interesting

The country has one of the larger rail networks in Europe with about 19,000 km. Especially the main routes between the most important cities have been expanded in recent years for more capacity and higher speeds. The top performer is the Gdansk - Warsaw - Katowice axis with up to 200 km/h. In contrast, there are some routes (especially in regional traffic) that can only be traveled at 60 km/h. In the future, however, high-speed lines with higher speeds across Poland are also planned.

The condition, density and frequency of railway lines are often very dependent on the region. In Lower Silesia (Dolnośląskie), for example, some routes have been reactivated and made more efficient in recent years. In general, however, it can be said that the frequencies are usually in need of improvement. On many routes, only individual trains per day are offered.

### Belarus

Currently no trains operate between Belarus and Poland.

### Germany

From Germany, the Polish network can be reached via several routes. The most used border crossing is in Frankfurt (Oder). Eurocity trains between Berlin and Warsaw run every 2 hours during the day via this crossing. In addition, individual services between Berlin and Gdynia / Krakow / Przemysl can also be found in the timetable.

In addition to long-distance trains, regional trains between Frankfurt (Oder) and Rzepin / Zielona Góra run approximately every 2 hours, which like the `EC` trains can be used with PKP FIP tickets plus ticket for the DB section. In long-distance traffic, the Horka border crossing will probably also be used from December 2025 for direct trains between Leipzig and Wrocław / Krakow.

The other border crossings are currently only served by regional traffic. For trains via Forst, Grambow, Guben and Tantow, the same rule applies as for Frankfurt (Oder), so PKP FIP tickets plus ticket for the DB section must be available. At Kostrzyn, the operator on the German side is Niederbarnimer Eisenbahn (NEB), for which no FIP tickets are valid; for the Polish section, PKP FIP tickets should be valid. A special feature is the Zgorzelec border crossing, where no ticket is required for the section between German Görlitz and Zgorzelec station.

### Lithuania

Between Lithuania and Poland, currently only one train pair daily is offered from Vilnius via Kaunas to Warsaw and Krakow. With this InterCity connection, you have to change trains once at the border in Mockava, as the two countries have different track gauges in their rail networks. However, the route is sold as one continuous connection in Poland and Lithuania, so there is a connection guarantee. With FIP tickets from PKP and Lithuanian LTG-Link plus paid reservation, you can travel completely with FIP here.

### Slovakia

The only regularly served cross-border route currently is the route from Slovak Skalite to Polish Zwardon. It is operated in cooperation by ZSSK with Koleje Śląskie. The FIP Coupon of Slovak ZSSK are valid up to the border point.

Theoretically, it should be possible to travel cross-border for free with an additional FIP Coupon of Koleje Śląskie, but this should be confirmed in advance. Cross-border FIP 50 tickets cannot be purchased through either the KŚ or ZSSK website, but may be possible at a KŚ or ZSSK ticket counter.

### Czechia

Between Czechia and Poland, regular trains are offered in both long-distance and regional traffic. Via Bohumin and Zebrzydowice, Eurocity trains run between Ostrava (sometimes coming from Vienna) to Katowice and Warsaw or to Krakow. These can be used with FIP tickets from PKP and ČD plus reservation. Regional trains via these two border crossings are operated partly by PKP and partly by KŚ. Via Cesky Tesin, regional trains run to Polish Cieszyn, which are operated on the Czech side by ČD; who operates these in Poland is currently unknown to us.

The same applies to regional trains between Mikulovice and Krnov, which make a short detour to Poland and stop in Głuchołazy. Easier is the Harrachov border crossing, via which regional trains run between Szklarska Poreba and Liberec. These trains are operated on the Polish side by KD and on the Czech side by ČD.

Via Lichkov, EC trains run between Wrocław (sometimes coming from Gdynia) and Prague, for which tickets from PKP and ČD plus reservation are required. Regional trains are operated on the Polish side by KD, on the Czech side it should be ČD without guarantee.

### Ukraine

Coming from Ukraine, you can travel to Poland either via the route Kyiv - Chełm or via Kyiv - Lviv - Przemyśl. Long-distance trains run on both routes, operated by Ukrzaliznytsia in the Ukrainian section and PKP Intercity on the Polish section. Continuous FIP tickets are not possible, as Ukrzaliznytsia is not a FIP member. So at most you can try to get a discount for the Polish partial section, but since this is very small, it is probably more sensible to simply buy a ticket at normal price.

### Russia

Currently no trains operate between Russia and Poland.
