<!-- The UK is a bit different. There are no train categories, but many operators, so you have to check where FIP is valid. It makes sense to list other operators without FIP, even if they are often trams and subways. Otherwise, it's hard for users to understand why FIP is valid on the Elizabeth Line but not on other Underground lines. -->

## FIP Information

In England, Scotland, and Wales, FIP is accepted by all train operators integrated into [National Rail]({{< ref "/operator/gb" >}} "National Rail"). This includes some urban rail operators in major cities, such as London Overground and the Elizabeth Line. Other modes of transport, such as subways and trams, are not included, as is usual with FIP. All operators accepting FIP are listed in the [list of operators]({{< ref "/operator/gb#train-categories-and-reservations" >}} "List of operators").

Northern Ireland, on the other hand, is served by its own railway company (NIR), where FIP discounts are explicitly valid for this company. Ferry connections between Great Britain and Northern Ireland with Stena Line can be used with FIP.

Additionally, there are [Eurostar]({{< ref "/operator/eurostar" >}} "Eurostar") trains to continental Europe, which can be used with FIP global fares. Alternatively, ferry connections to the Netherlands between Harwich and Hoek van Holland or ferry connections to Ireland can be used with FIP.

## Interesting

The United Kingdom is the birthplace of the railway, and it has a long tradition. The rail network covers the whole country, with many (direct) connections to all regions. The quality of trains and stations varies greatly, as many operators act independently. Some offer modern and comfortable trains, while others still use older models.

There are also many large historic stations such as London Paddington, London King's Cross, London St. Pancras, Bristol Temple Meads, or York. Numerous [heritage railways]({{< ref "/operator/gb#heritage-railways--historic-journeys" >}} "Heritage Railways") offer discounted fares for FIP holders.

A special highlight is traveling through the breathtaking landscapes of the Scottish Highlands or the idyllic Cornwall. Both destinations are easily accessible by night trains via the Caledonian Sleeper or the Night Riviera Sleeper.

Additionally, there are many leisure and tourist attractions that offer "2FOR1" deals for holders of National Rail tickets. By presenting a FIP 50 Ticket or another valid National Rail ticket (excluding FIP Coupons), you receive two admission tickets for the price of one. More information can be found at the [Days Out Guide](https://www.daysoutguide.co.uk/).

### Travel between the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland

Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom but is served by its own railway company (NIR). Due to the separation by the Irish Sea, there are no direct train connections between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. Instead, there are ferry connections that can be used with FIP.

From Belfast, Stena Line ferries operate to Cairnryan in Scotland and Liverpool in England. Stena Line ferry connections can be used at a discount with Stena Line FIP Coupons or FIP 50 Tickets. Alternatively, [_Rail & Sail_](https://www.seat61.com/train-and-ferry-to-belfast.htm) tickets are offered, which allow combined train and ferry travel at a reduced price. No additional FIP discount is available on these tickets.

### France and Belgium

From Paris Nord, Lille Europe, and Brussels Midi, [Eurostar trains]({{< ref "/operator/eurostar" >}} "Eurostar page") run to London St. Pancras International. These trains require reservations and FIP Global Fare tickets must be purchased.

From Calais, there is also the LeShuttle car train through the Eurotunnel, but no FIP discount is granted. Additionally, there are various ferry connections between France/Belgium and Great Britain, but no FIP discount is granted on these.

### Netherlands

From Amsterdam and Rotterdam, direct [Eurostar]({{< ref "/operator/eurostar" >}} "Eurostar") trains run to London St. Pancras. Alternatively, [Eurostar Red]({{< ref "/operator/eurostar" >}} "Eurostar Red") and [Eurocity]({{< ref "/operator/ns#train-categories-and-reservations" >}} "Eurocity") trains run to Brussels Midi (Belgium), where you can transfer to a [Eurostar Blue]({{< ref "/operator/eurostar" >}} "Eurostar Blue") train to London St. Pancras. Eurostar trains always require reservations and FIP Global Fare tickets must be purchased.

Additionally, there is a ferry connection from Hoek van Holland to Harwich, which can be used at a discount with FIP. Note that the RET Metro from Rotterdam / Nesselande to Hoek van Holland does not grant FIP discounts.

### Ireland

From Dublin and Rosslare, Irish Ferries and Stena Line ferries operate to Holyhead and Fishguard in Wales. Stena Line ferry connections can be used at a discount with Stena Line FIP Coupons or FIP 50 Tickets. Alternatively, [_Rail & Sail_](https://www.seat61.com/train-and-ferry-to-belfast.htm) tickets are offered, which allow combined train and ferry travel at a reduced price. No additional FIP discount is available on these tickets.

From Dublin, the Enterprise train also runs to Belfast in Northern Ireland, which can be used at a discount with FIP. To use this train, a FIP Coupon for Ireland (CIE) and Northern Ireland (NIR) or a through FIP 50 Ticket is required.
