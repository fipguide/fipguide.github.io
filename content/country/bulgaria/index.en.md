## FIP Information

In Bulgaria, FIP can be used relatively easily, but online booking options are very limited. The Bulgarian State Railways Balgarski Darschawni Schelesnizi ([BDŽ]({{< ref "/operator/bdz" >}} "BDZ")) is currently almost the only passenger rail operator in the country. FIP is accepted here. With a valid FIP Coupon, you only need to buy reservations for reservation-required trains at the ticket office. FIP 50 Tickets can also be purchased at the ticket office. For international journeys, the required tickets are only available at special international ticket counters at major stations.

## Interesting

The rail network in Bulgaria is mainly oriented east-west, with various routes connecting the country's largest cities. One of the most important routes is from Sofia to Varna, which can be taken either via Pleven (north) or Plovdiv (south). There are also a few north-south routes, mainly serving as feeders to the main lines.

The network is rather old and most connections are quite slow. There is no real regular-interval timetable, and most routes are served by only a few trains per day. Exceptions exist in suburban traffic, for example between Plovdiv and Asenovgrad, where trains run about every 75 minutes. Delays are not uncommon, but on long routes, these are often made up thanks to generous buffer times.

The route highlights include, on the one hand, the north–south lines running through the Balkan Mountains, and on the other hand — and especially — the Rhodope Railway between Septemvri and Dobrinishte: a narrow-gauge line operated by BDŽ and therefore usable with a FIP Ticket. Dining cars are also used on this line.

### Greece

Currently, there are no passenger trains between Greece and Bulgaria.

### Romania

There are a few daily trains between Romania and Bulgaria, which are the most important rail link between Bulgaria and the rest of Europe. Especially in the summer season, these trains are relevant, as there is then a daily through train pair between the capitals Bucharest and Sofia, and via through coaches to the Black Sea at Varna and even overnight to Istanbul, Turkey. Outside the season, this train pair only runs between Bucharest and Ruse, the first stop in Bulgaria, where a change is required. To use these cross-border trains with FIP, you need either FIP Coupons for both countries or a continuous FIP 50 Ticket. In addition, a reservation is mandatory for the entire journey. Outside the summer season, a reservation for the Bulgarian section from Ruse is sufficient. For the night train, a berth in a couchette or sleeper car can also be reserved for an additional fee.

Another daily connection exists via the Vidin border crossing, with a train from Craiova (Romania) to Vidin (Bulgaria). For this route, FIP Coupons for both countries or a continuous FIP 50 Ticket are sufficient.

### Serbia

Currently, only the private Optima Express runs once a week across the border between Serbia and Bulgaria. This train runs from Villach (Austria) to Turkey and uses some lines that are otherwise not served by passenger trains. Car transport is also possible. FIP is not valid on any part of this route, and disembarking is only possible in Edirne, Turkey. More information is available on the [Optima Express website](https://optimatours.de/en).

### Turkey

During the summer season, a night train runs between Istanbul Halkali and various destinations in Bulgaria, including Sofia and Plovdiv, or via Ruse north to Bucharest, Romania. Since FIP is not valid in Turkey, you can only use a FIP 50 Ticket or FIP Coupon for the Bulgarian or Romanian section. For through journeys, it may be easier to buy a full-price ticket including a berth or sleeper.

For the route between Turkey and Bulgaria, tickets can only be purchased at an international ticket counter on site. If Romania is the start or end point, tickets can also be bought via the [Romanian State Railways CFR](https://bileteinternationale.cfrcalatori.ro/en/). The private Optima Express also runs on this route, but FIP is not valid ([see Serbia](#serbia)).
