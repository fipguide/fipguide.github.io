## FIP Information

Czechia is not the easiest country for using FIP, but it is still quite possible to travel with it. The Czech state railway České dráhy ([ČD](/operator/cd "ČD")) is the only FIP operator in the country, but it also operates a large part of the rail network.

However, note that FIP is no longer valid on all routes operated by ČD. There are also some _commercial services_ where a supplement must be paid. With a FIP Coupon, all these exceptions must be considered, while FIP 50 Tickets sold by ČD should make it easier to see which trains are valid. Private operators like Arriva or Die Länderbahn do not accept FIP at all, but tickets in Czechia are generally quite affordable.

## Interesting

Czechia has one of the densest rail networks in the world. It is possible to reach many places in the country by train. Speeds are usually not very high, and there are currently no high-speed lines in the country. Nevertheless, travel comfort is usually good, or there is at least a certain nostalgia in older trains.

Prague is considered the center of the rail network, with connections in all directions. The route to Ostrava is probably the most important in the country, served at a high frequency.

Otherwise, most routes are served hourly or every two hours. Czechia has many scenic routes, often following mountains or rivers, such as from Karlovy Vary to Johanngeorgenstadt, Ceske Budejovice to Cesky Krumlov, or Prague to Usti nad Labem.

Punctuality is solid, and connecting trains often wait, but not in major hubs like Praha hl. n. The latter is also one of the most beautiful stations in the country.

### Germany

There are various rail border crossings from Germany that can be used. The most well-known is Schöna, used by international long-distance trains between the two countries. There are also cross-border regional trains every 2 hours, which, like the `RJ`/`RJX` trains, are operated in cooperation by Deutsche Bahn and ČD, so FIP Coupons from both countries or a continuous FIP 50 Ticket are valid for the journey.

The same applies to the northern section of the regional train, which crosses the border again at Dolní Poustevna (route Decin – Bad Schandau – Sebnitz – Rumburk).

The other border crossings are only served by regional trains. The easiest is Bayerisch Eisenstein, as it is not only a border point but also the border station. From here, a FIP Ticket / Coupon from ČD is sufficient to continue into Czechia.

At Potůčky on the Johanngeorgenstadt – Karlovy Vary route, FIP Tickets from DB and ČD can be used for cross-border travel. The other crossings are a bit more complicated.

At Cheb, cross-border trains operated by DB Regio can be used with FIP Coupons from both countries or a continuous FIP 50 Ticket. For trains operated by Agilis (operated by ČD on the Czech side), a regular ticket must be purchased for the German section (a Deutschlandticket is also valid from Schirnding).

The same applies to the northern border crossing at Aš. Similarly, at Furth im Wald, the cross-border regional express, which is an EC in the Czech section, can be used with a ČD FIP Ticket in Czechia, but a regular ticket is needed for the German section.

At the border crossings Hrádek nad Nisou (route Zittau – Liberec), Varnsdorf (route Seifhennersdorf – Zittau), Vejprty (route Cranzahl – Chomutov, only served in summer on weekends and holidays), and Vojtanov (route Zwickau – Cheb), FIP is useless, as on both sides of the border the trains are operated by private railways that do not accept FIP.

### Austria

From Austria, cross-border trains of ÖBB can be used on various routes. An additional FIP 50 Ticket or FIP Coupon from ÖBB is required. Cross-border trains from RegioJet cannot be used with FIP. Long-distance connections exist from Linz to Prague and Railjets from Vienna to Prague via Brno.

### Poland

There are regular trains between Poland and Czechia, both long-distance and regional. Eurocity trains run via Zebrzydowice and Bohumin between Krakow or Warsaw and Ostrava (sometimes continuing to Vienna). These can be used with FIP Tickets from PKP and ČD plus reservation. Regional trains over these two border crossings are sometimes operated by PKP and sometimes by KŚ. Regional trains via Cesky Tesin run to Polish Cieszyn, operated by ČD on the Czech side; the Polish operator is currently unknown.

The same applies to regional trains between Mikulovice and Krnov, which make a short detour into Poland and stop at Głuchołazy. The Harrachov border crossing is easier, with regional trains between Szklarska Poreba and Liberec. These trains are operated by KD on the Polish side and ČD on the Czech side.

`EC` trains run via Lichkov between Wrocław (sometimes originating from Gdynia) and Prague, for which tickets from PKP and ČD plus a reservation are required. Regional trains are operated by KD on the Polish side and by LEO Express on the Czech side. Therefore, FIP discounts are not valid on the Czech section.

### Slovakia

From Slovakia, cross-border trains of ČD or ZSSK can be used on various routes. An additional FIP 50 Ticket or FIP Coupon from ZSR is required. Cross-border trains from RegioJet cannot be used with FIP.
