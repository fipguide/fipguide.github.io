## FIP Usage

In Denmark, it is possible to travel across the country on main routes using FIP 50 and FIP Coupon. The Danske Statsbaner ([DSB]({{< ref "/operator/dsb" >}} "DSB")) operates a continuous network, with some branch lines operated by private railway companies (e.g., GoCollective) where FIP is not accepted. FIP discounts are also not available for night trains passing through Denmark operated by SJ and Snälltåget. Connections from Copenhagen towards Sweden are similarly excluded.

## Interesting

Denmark has a relatively dense railway network that connects both the mainland of Jutland and the islands of Falster, Zealand, and Funen. The network is interconnected. The country distinguishes between regional and long-distance trains in terms of fares. Additionally, there are often special fares per operator (e.g., a special weekend day pass for GoCollective's network), but cross-operator tickets can also be purchased.

The main routes in Denmark are the north-south connection Aalborg-Aarhus-Kolding-(Hamburg) and the east-west connection (Malmö)-Copenhagen-Odense-Fredericia-Esbjerg. Long-distance trains operate on these routes with above-average speeds, though true high-speed travel is limited to a small section between Odense and Copenhagen, which only a few trains fully utilize.

Trains in Denmark typically run on a regular schedule and are generally punctual. However, connections are not always well-coordinated, which can lead to waiting times during transfers. The frequency of service on some routes could also be improved. In the capital city of Copenhagen, the S-train network and many frequently running regional train lines provide an especially dense rail service.

### Germany

From Germany, the direct EC Hamburg - Copenhagen can be used, operating multiple times daily (every 2 hours during the peak season). These trains are always very crowded, so early reservation booking is recommended. Alternatively, there are multiple daily IC trains from Flensburg to Fredericia, with good connections to Aarhus/Aalborg and Copenhagen. Entry via Tønder is also possible using local trains. However, since neither DB on the German side nor DSB on the Danish side operates here, FIP discounts are not available on this route. Alternatively, ferries from Puttgarden or Warnemünde can be used to enter Denmark.

### Sweden
From Sweden, travel is possible either via Malmö over the Øresund or via Helsingborg using the ferry to Helsingør. Since FIP discounts do not apply in Sweden and the Øresund route is operated by Øresundståg, regular tickets must be purchased for the entire Malmö - Copenhagen route.
