## FIP Information

In Spain, using FIP is not always straightforward, as simply boarding and riding along rarely works. On most routes, a ticket at the FIP Global Fare must be booked in advance. Since only as many tickets are sold as there are available seats, this purchase should not be made at the last minute (even for regional trains). [Renfe]({{< ref "/operator/renfe" >}} "Renfe") is the largest railway operator in Spain and accepts FIP. On lucrative routes, it competes with many private providers like OUIGO or Iryo, which do not accept FIP. Another provider in the Basque Country is Euskotren, which also accepts FIP.

## Insteresting

Spain does not have a particularly dense rail network; instead, it mainly consists of new high-speed standard gauge lines and older regional lines in Iberian broad gauge. The focus is on (mostly fast) connections between major cities. In addition, there are suburban trains in and around the metropolitan areas that ensure dense local transport.

Stations usually have ticket barriers, which require a valid digital or analog ticket on a card to pass through. With FIP Coupons, staff on site must be approached so they can manually open the barriers. Furthermore, for long-distance travel, luggage checks are conducted at the stations. While not as strict as at airports, they still take time. Therefore, it is recommended to arrive at the station at least 30 minutes before departure for such trips.

### France

From Paris, direct TGV trains operated by the French SNCF run to Barcelona. Renfe also operates cross-border services between Lyon and Barcelona. FIP Global Fares are available with both operators, although they can be very expensive. Overall, there are very few cross-border connections, and the network was significantly better developed just a few years ago.

### Portugal

Connections between Spain and Portugal are currently very limited. For example, to travel from Lisbon to Madrid, one must change trains and take a long regional journey to the Spanish border at Badajoz, where one of the few trains to Madrid can be caught. This requires FIP tickets or free passes from Portuguese rail operator CP, as well as a Renfe ticket for the Spanish section. Additionally, there is the Celta connection from Porto to Vigo, although this does not extend further into Spain. A FIP Global Fare is valid for the entire route ([See Renfe - Celta]({{< ref "/operator/renfe#international" >}} "Renfe")). A continuous high-speed rail line between Lisbon and Madrid is currently under development.
