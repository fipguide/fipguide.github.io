## FIP Information

In Switzerland, there are three different operators for which FIP Free Passes and FIP 50 Tickets can be obtained:

- The state railway company [SBB CFF FFS]({{< ref "/operator/sbb" >}} "SBB CFF FFS") (Swiss Federal Railways), which operates most of the main lines
- A consortium of Swiss private railways ([SP]({{< ref "/404" >}} "SP"))
- The Bernese Alpine Railway Company Bern–Lötschberg–Simplon ([BLS]({{< ref "/404" >}} "BLS"))

Combined, these cover almost the entire Swiss rail network, including some modes of transport that are uniquely included in FIP across Europe, such as certain cable cars or specific bus lines.

Only a few very tourist-oriented services are not included in FIP. Cross-border journeys to France and Italy require some effort, as special surcharges apply.

## Insteresting

Switzerland has one of the densest rail networks in the world. Despite challenging topography, most of the country is accessible by train. Trains run frequently, especially on main lines, and are well coordinated in an integrated timetable. Although most lines are not built for very high speeds, short connections often result in manageable travel times. The Swiss rail system is also known for its punctuality, though exceptions exist. The country is well connected by rail to its neighbors, with regular trains.

### Germany

There are several cross-border connections from Germany to Switzerland:

- The most used is from Freiburg im Breisgau to Basel. `ICE` trains run here usually once or twice per hour in each direction, coming from Hamburg, Kassel, Frankfurt (Main), or Hannover, Dortmund, Cologne, Frankfurt (Main), and then sharing the same route between Mannheim and Basel. In Switzerland, some continue to Zurich, Interlaken, Bern, or Chur.
- There are also occasional `EC` and `ECE` trains on the route, also from Mannheim.
- Regional trains run from Germany to Basel as well.

Note that DB FIP free travel passes are valid up to Basel Bad Bf (Badischer Bahnhof), as this is an official border station (border point) for DB and SBB.

To enter Switzerland without using an SBB ticket (e.g. FIP Coupon or FIP 50), you can use S-Bahn line 6 from Basel Badischer Bahnhof to Basel SBB with the Deutschland-Ticket. [^1]

Other important cross-border connections include the routes Stuttgart – Zurich via Schaffhausen (a joint border station of SBB and DB) and Munich – Zurich via Lindau and St. Gallen, which are served by `IC` and `ECE` trains. When traveling from Lindau to St. Gallen, the route briefly passes through Austria, so an ÖBB ticket is required for this section.

{{% highlight tip %}}
For this short section, it's best to buy a FIP 50 Ticket, otherwise the [ÖBB long-distance surcharge]({{< ref "/country/austria#schweiz" >}} "Arrival Switzerland") must theoretically be paid.

There are also several cross-border regional connections. Switzerland can also be reached by ferries, some of which accept FIP.

### France

From France the are different connections:

- Direct `TGV` trains from Paris to Basel or Geneva.
- Regional trains via Pontarlier, Vallorbe, etc.

On `TGV` trains, standard FIP tickets are not valid. A FIP Global Fare ticket is required. For regional trains, a FIP 50 Ticket or coupons from both operators are sufficient.

### Italy

From Italy, both long-distance and regional trains cross into Switzerland. From Milan, you can reach Switzerland via Como or Domodossola. Trains via Como usually continue to Zurich, those via Domodossola to Bern and Basel. Both Eurocity and regional trains operate on these routes. Other border crossings are only served by regional trains. Eurocity trains require a reservation with a surcharge.

`ECE` trains also run from Frankfurt to Milan. The surcharge for cross-border trains to Italy is €11 (2nd class) or €13 (1st class), including a seat reservation (e.g. to Frankfurt).

{{% highlight tip %}}
On the Milan - Como - Switzerland route, it may be worthwhile to travel between Milan and Chiasso (first station in Switzerland) by regional train. Trenord operates here and does not accept FIP Tickets, but the fare is relatively cheap compared to the required cross-border reservation on Eurocity trains. Changing trains in Chiasso can be a much more cost-effective option. The more comfortable but expensive option remains the direct `EC` and `ECE` trains.

### Liechtenstein

Liechtenstein and Switzerland are only connected by a few trains during the week. These cross-border S-Bahn trains run only during peak hours and are operated by the Austrian Federal Railways [(ÖBB)]({{< ref "/operator/oebb#lichtenstein" >}} "ÖBB"). ÖBB free passes and FIP 50 Tickets are valid up to the border point Buchs in Switzerland.

Otherwise, cross-border traffic is mainly handled by buses, where FIP Tickets are not valid.

### Austria

Austria and Switzerland have only one main border crossing, at St. Margrethen. Mainly regional trains run here, but also Eurocity trains, which in Austria only stop in Bregenz and otherwise come from Germany (Munich). Another border crossing is at Buchs, which is actually the border to Liechtenstein, but [ÖBB FIP Tickets]({{< ref "/operator/oebb#lichtenstein" >}} "ÖBB") are still valid in Liechtenstein. Thus, it is possible to have a continuous ticket between Austria and Switzerland with, for example, ÖBB and SBB Ccoupons. This is also the main route between the two countries, with Austrian Railjet and Eurocity trains running between Vienna / Graz and Zurich, as well as regional trains.
