## FIP Information

In Italy, local trains are mostly operated by [Trenitalia]({{< ref "/operator/fs" >}} "Trenitalia") and can be used with FIP Tickets. Exceptions are trains operated by Trenord in northern Italy and Ferrovie Sud Est (even if the trains have Trenitalia logos). In the Naples area, some narrow-gauge lines are not operated by Trenitalia and cannot be used with FIP Tickets.

For long-distance travel, the Frecce trains of Trenitalia can only be used with expensive reservations (including surcharge). Additionally, trains of the private operator Italo are not usable with FIP Tickets.

## Interesting

Italy has an extensive rail network. The fast and high-quality long-distance connections are particularly noteworthy, making it possible to travel between northern and southern Italy in a short time. Away from the high-speed lines, there are many classic and sometimes very scenic regional train routes. For example, the railway line through Cinque Terre in Liguria, where trains stop frequently in all five towns, is the most important connection between these otherwise hard-to-reach places. Regional trains in Italy do not run on a classic regular interval timetable, but usually at irregular intervals. Sardinia can be reached by night and InterCity trains, which cross the Strait of Messina by Trenitalia ferry.

### Slovenia

From Slovenia, regional trains can be used to enter Italy via Villa Opicina. FIP Tickets or FIP Coupons of both countries (FS and SŽ) or a through FIP Ticket (FIP 50) are required. These trains run infrequently, so planning is recommended.

There are also Eurocity connections from Austria via Slovenia to Trieste (`EC` 151/134). On the Italian section (Villa Opicina - Trieste), the ÖBB FIP Coupon is valid, but a small long-distance surcharge must be paid, which is much lower than typical FS long-distance surcharges.

The border crossing at Nova Gorica (Gorizia Centrale - Nova Gorica) is only used for passenger traffic on special occasions.

Booking FIP Tickets or FIP Coupons for the cross-border section between Slovenia and Italy is not possible online. However, very cheap regular tickets for the cross-border section can be purchased via Trenitalia. These are more expensive via SŽ.

### Switzerland

From Switzerland, both cross-border long-distance and regional trains can be used to travel to Italy. Milan can be reached via Como or Domodossola from the Swiss network. Trains via Como usually come from Zurich, those via Domodossola from Bern and Basel. Both routes have Eurocity connections and regional trains. Other border crossings can only be crossed by regional trains. For cross-border Eurocity trains, a reservation is required, which includes a surcharge. The `ECE` train Frankfurt – Milan and the `EC` trains Zurich – Milan also operate.

The surcharge or reservation price for cross-border `EC`/`ECE` trains to Italy is €20 (1st/2nd class). If booked at a DB travel center, the reservation/surcharge is only €10 (2nd class) or €13 (1st class) and includes a seat reservation (e.g., to Frankfurt).

{{% highlight tip %}}
For the Milan – Como – Switzerland route, it may be worthwhile to travel between Milan and Chiasso (first station in Switzerland) by regional train (`RE 80`). Trenord operates on this route and does not accept FIP Tickets or FIP Coupons. However, tickets are bookable online on the Trenord website and are comparatively cheap, unlike the required cross-border reservation in Eurocity trains. Changing trains in Chiasso can therefore be a much more cost-effective option. The more comfortable but expensive option remains the direct `EC` and `ECE` trains.

### Austria

There are two international routes from Austria to Italy:

- The Brenner railway: With Eurocity trains from Munich via Innsbruck and the Brenner Pass to Bolzano and Verona, and S3 trains from Brenner to Innsbruck. From Brenner, regional trains to Bolzano can be used.
- The route via Tarvisio Boscoverde: With Railjets from Vienna to Venice and some regional trains from Villach to Trieste.

On these routes, the ÖBB FIP Ticket or FIP Coupon is also valid on the Italian section for long-distance trains (`EC` and `RJ`), but a surcharge must be paid from the Italian border. This can be paid directly on the train.

### France

Between Milan and Paris, cross-border Frecciarossa trains operate. FIP Tickets or FIP Coupons do not apply in France for these trains.

Additionally, competing `TGV` trains of SNCF run between Turin and Paris. These can be used in France with FIP discounts, but FIP Global Fare tickets must be purchased.

Cross-border regional trains of SNCF can be used from Grasse/Cannes/Nice via Monaco to Ventimiglia. FIP Tickets and FIP Coupons of SNCF are valid to Ventimiglia.
