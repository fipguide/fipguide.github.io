## FIP Information

In the Netherlands, FIP 50 tickets and FIP Coupons can be used on a large part of the rail network. The [Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS)]({{< ref "/operator/ns" >}} "NS") is the national railway company and operates most of the country's main lines. FIP is widely accepted here, with only a few exceptions for certain routes and trains.

Additionally, international [Eurostar]({{< ref "/operator/eurostar" >}} "Eurostar") trains operate, which can be used at a discount with special FIP Global Fares. These trains are listed as train category `EST` in journey planners.

Other operators such as Arriva Nederland or the cross-border RE trains Arnhem - Düsseldorf, Venlo - Hamm, and Maastricht - Aachen unfortunately do not accept FIP. All buses (except rail replacement services), trams, and metros are also excluded.

## Interesting

The Netherlands has a very dense rail network, offering some of the best regular interval services internationally. Most routes are served at least every 30 minutes, with main lines much more frequently. The main rail hub is not Amsterdam, but Utrecht, where many north-south and east-west connections meet. During peak hours, there are up to ten trains per hour and direction between Utrecht and Amsterdam or between Arnhem and Nijmegen. Internationally, the Netherlands is well connected to Belgium and Germany, with both fast and slower services.

A special feature in the Netherlands is that almost all larger stations have ticket gates. Access to the platforms is only possible with a valid ticket containing a suitable QR code. For NS FIP Coupons, a separate NS Gate Pass Coupon is provided. FIP 50 tickets should have a valid QR code or also include a separate coupon. If there is no way to open the gate, assistance can be requested at the gate.

### Germany

From Germany, the cross-border ICE from Frankfurt / Cologne / Düsseldorf can be used to enter the NS network. For cross-border journeys, an additional DB ticket is required. There are also various regional trains, but only two are valid with FIP: the connections from Dortmund to Enschede and Münster to Enschede. Here, DB Regio operates on the German section. With an additional ticket for the German section of DB, you are covered. On the RE routes Hamm - Venlo and Düsseldorf - Arnhem, the Deutschlandticket is valid for the entire route. If you have this ticket, you can also enter the Netherlands.

### Belgium

From Belgium, cross-border regional trains (including the IC here) can be used, but an additional FIP ticket from SNCB is required. There are also long-distance trains (ECD and EC), where an additional supplement may be required when traveling on the Rotterdam - Schiphol axis. With the Eurostar (formerly Thalys), you can also reach the SNCB network from the Netherlands. Here, a special FIP ticket from Eurostar is required for the entire route (including within the Netherlands). ([see Eurostar]({{% ref "/operator/eurostar" %}} "Eurostar"))
