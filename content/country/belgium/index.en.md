## FIP Information

In Belgium, both FIP 50 and FIP Coupons can be extensively used. The Belgian National Railway operator [SNCB](/operator/sncb "SNCB") (Société nationale des chemins de fer belges) or [NMBS](/operator/sncb "NMBS") (Nationale Maatschappij der Belgische Spoorwegen) is almost the sole operator of public passenger trains and can be used with FIP. Special attention should be paid to surcharges for Brussels Airport Zaventem.

Additionally, international [Eurostar](/operator/eurostar "Eurostar") trains operate, which can be used at a discount with special FIP Tickets. The trains are listed as train category `EST` in the connection information.

Furthermore, international `TGV` trains of the [SNCF](/operator/sncf "SNCF") from France operate, for which the FIP Coupon of SNCB are not valid. Only special FIP Global Fares can be booked for these trains. For the Eurocity trains from Brussels to Paris operated by OUIGO, no FIP discounts apply.

## Interesting

Belgium has an extensive and dense rail network. Unlike other countries, there is no real fare distinction between train categories in Belgium, except for international `ICE`, `TGV`, and Eurostar connections. Due to the central location of the capital Brussels, it is the hub of Belgian train traffic and is connected via 4 high-speed lines to Germany, France, and the Netherlands.

On other routes, the speed is rather average. Trains in Belgium usually run on a regular schedule and are mostly punctual. The most important cities are connected several times an hour.

Particularly noteworthy are the impressive station buildings of Liège-Guillemins and Antwerp Central.

### Luxembourg

From Luxembourg, cross-border SNCB trains to Liège or Brussels can be used. In 2nd class, the FIP Ticket (Coupon or FIP 50) is sufficient for the entire route, as public transport in Luxembourg is free in 2nd class. For 1st class, an additional FIP Ticket for CFL is required.

### Germany

From Germany, the cross-border `ICE` from Frankfurt / Cologne / Aachen can be used to enter the SNCB network. A regional train of SNCB also runs between Aachen and Liège. In both cases, an additional ticket for the German section of DB is required.

The Eurostar (formerly Thalys) can also be used from Germany to reach the SNCB network. Here, a special FIP Ticket from Eurostar is required for the entire section including within Belgium. ([see Eurostar](/operator/eurostar "Eurostar"))

### Netherlands

From the Netherlands, cross-border regional trains (including the `IC`) can be used; for these, an additional FIP Ticket from NS is required. Furthermore, long-distance trains (`ECD` and `EC`) operate, where an extra surcharge may apply on the Dutch section (between Rotterdam and Schiphol).

The Eurostar (formerly Thalys) can also be used from the Netherlands to reach the SNCB network. Here, a special FIP Ticket from Eurostar is required for the entire section, including within Belgium. ([see Eurostar](/operator/eurostar "Eurostar"))

### France

From France, SNCF operates international `TGV` trains from Brussels to Lyon, Marseille, Rennes, Nantes, and Strasbourg. For these, expensive FIP Global Fare tickets must be purchased. There is also an OUIGO connection from Paris to Brussels, which cannot be used with FIP.

Alternatively, [Eurostar](/operator/eurostar "Eurostar") trains run from Paris to Brussels, which can also be used with FIP Global Fare tickets, and are cheaper than the `TGV` trains.

There are also various `TER` regional train connections from France to Belgium that can be used with FIP. For example, between Lille and Namur as well as between Lille and Antwerp. Normal FIP 50 Tickets as well as a combination of an FIP Coupon from SNCB and SNCF are valid on these routes.
