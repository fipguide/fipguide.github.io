## FIP Information

The main railway company in Latvia is the state-owned Latvijas dzelzceļš (LDz). However, FIP discounts do not apply to this operator.

Additionally, the Lithuanian railway company [LTG-Link](/operator/ltg) operates trains from the Lithuanian capital Vilnius via the Latvian capital Riga to Valga. FIP discounts are valid on the Latvian section up to Riga under the same conditions as in Lithuania.

## Interesting

Latvia’s railway network is based on the 1520 mm broad gauge. Passenger traffic is concentrated in Riga; the main station serves as a central hub from which most regional and suburban lines depart. Electrification is largely limited to the suburban routes in the Riga area and uses 3 kV DC, while the rest of the network is mostly operated with diesel. At the same time, the new international Rail Baltica corridor is under construction, with work clearly visible around the main station.
