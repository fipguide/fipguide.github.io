## FIP Information

The railway in Liechtenstein is operated by the [Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB)]({{% ref "/operator/oebb" %}} "ÖBB"). All ÖBB tickets are valid here, including FIP 50 Tickets and FIP Coupons for ÖBB. ÖBB FIP conditions also apply in Liechtenstein.

## Interesting

Only one railway line runs through Liechtenstein - the approximately 8 km long route from Feldkirch (Austria) to Buchs SG (Switzerland), which includes three stations on Liechtenstein territory. This route is part of the international long-distance connection Vienna - Salzburg - Innsbruck - Switzerland and is operated by the Austrian Federal Railways.

The Liechtenstein stations Nendeln, Forst Hilti (Schaan) and Schaan-Vaduz (Schaan) are served exclusively by local trains. The service is limited to a minimum for commuters: Only on weekdays, a few local trains operate in each direction between Feldkirch and Buchs SG in the early morning, at noon and in the late afternoon.

## Arrival and Border Points

Information about arrival and border points can be found on the [country page for Austria]({{% ref "/country/austria" %}} "Austria").
