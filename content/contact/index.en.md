## FIP Guide Community

You can easily share your questions and travel experiences with the FIP Guide team and other FIP travelers through the FIP Guide Community.

The FIP Guide Community is available on the online platform _Discord_ and supports English, German, and French. Optionally, you can also specify which railway company you work for. This way, others can immediately see where your expertise lies.
