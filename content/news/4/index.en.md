Starting May 1, 2025, Eurostar will increase prices on all FIP tickets by €5 or £5. The price increase applies to all FIP Global Fares for Eurostar Blue and Eurostar Red (Thalys) in all classes. The new prices apply to all bookings made from May 1, 2025 onwards. [^1]

**Update 17.06.2025:** \
The announcement has since been removed from the Rail Delivery Group's website. It is unclear whether the price increase will still take effect or if it has been withdrawn. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as soon as there is news. Currently, bookings at the old prices are still possible.
