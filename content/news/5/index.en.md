---

Starting June 15, 2025, Deutsche Bahn will no longer offer family reservations. Previously, it was possible to book a family reservation for €10.40 in 2nd class or €13 in 1st class, which covered up to 5 people. In the future, a separate reservation must be purchased for each adult and child. [^1]

Additionally, the prices for seat reservations will increase:

1st class: €6.90 (previously €6.50)
2nd class: €5.90 (previously €5.50)

Information about reservations on Bahn.de can be found [here]({{< ref "/booking/db_website" >}} "DB Website Booking").
