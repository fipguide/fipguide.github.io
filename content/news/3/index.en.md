title: "FIP withdrawal of Finnish State Railways VR"
---

The Finnish State Railways VR has announced its withdrawal from the FIP program by the end of 2025. The withdrawal was originally planned for 2024 but was postponed by one year. As of 01.01.2026, FIP travel discounts for VR will no longer be available. It is not yet known whether the withdrawal will be postponed again.

The reason for this could be VR's withdrawal from the UIC (Union Internationale des Chemins de fer - International Union of Railways) to save membership fees. There have been no official statements from VR so far. More information can be found in [Finnish railway forums](https://vaunut.org/keskustelut/index.php?topic=15586.0).

We will provide further information as soon as it becomes available.
