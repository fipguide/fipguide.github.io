Our FIP Guide Community is now open to everyone interested! In the community, you can ask questions about using FIP tickets, exchange ideas with others, and benefit from the experiences of the community. Whether you are looking for travel planning tips, need information about border points, or want to stay updated on current changes – this is the right place for you.

The FIP Guide Community is accessible via the online platform _Discord_ and is available in English, German, and French. Optionally, you can also specify which railway company you work for, so others can immediately see where your expertise lies.
