---

As of January 1, 2024, the Lithuanian State Railways (LTG Link) is an official member of FIP. Railway employees benefit from free rides and discounted tickets on international rail routes. This cooperation strengthens cross-border mobility and makes it even more attractive for railway employees to use the railways for private travel.

The Lithuanian State Railways LTG Link (Lietuvos Geležinkeliai) is the national railway operator of Lithuania and plays a central role in the country's rail transport. It is responsible for passenger and freight transport as well as the maintenance of the rail infrastructure. LTG was founded in 1919 and has since developed into an important player in Baltic rail transport.

The Lithuanian rail network covers approximately 1,900 kilometers and is broad-gauge (1,520 mm), making it compatible with the rail networks of the Baltic neighboring states and the former Soviet Union. It connects important cities such as Vilnius, Kaunas, and Klaipėda and also offers international connections to Latvia, Belarus, and Poland. A significant European infrastructure project is the standard-gauge "Rail Baltica," which connects Lithuania with the Central European railway network. However, the planned completion of this international connection remains unclear.

By joining FIP, LTG is signaling its integration into the international rail network and at the same time strengthening the attractiveness of rail as a sustainable mode of transport.

Information on the use of travel discounts with FIP in Lithuania will be available here on the site shortly.
